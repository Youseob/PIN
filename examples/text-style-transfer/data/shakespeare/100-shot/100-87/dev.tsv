"Therefore in my presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee."""	0
As I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to thee for't.	0
Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty, I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her.	0
Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy.	0
Sooth, but you must.	0
Too well what love women to men may owe.	0
Why, what are you?	0
I have't in my nose too.	0
Who does do you wrong?	0
I can not love him.	0
"Who you are and what you would are out of my welkin, I might say ""element, "" but the word is overworn."	0
Let me enjoy my private.	0
Ay, ay.	0
Will you walk towards him?	0
It alone concerns your ear.	0
The honorable lady of the house, which is she?	0
Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse for my friends.	0
With drinking healths to my niece.	0
One draught above heat makes him a fool, the second mads him, and a third drowns him.	0
It may be worth thy pains, for I can sing And speak to him in many sorts of music That will allow me very worth his service.	0
I mean, to go, sir, to enter.	0
"Why, ""some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrown upon them."" I was one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir Topas, sir, but that's all one."	0
Taste your legs, sir.	0
What, what?	0
These wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report, after fourteen years' purchase.	0
Malvolio's coming down this walk.	0
Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture?	0
If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake my bounty further.	0
Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!	0
See him delivered, Fabian ; bring him hither.	0
Madam, I will.	0
What's she?	0
I could not find him at the Elephant.	0
I do remember.	0
Thou canst not choose but know who I am.	0
There's one at the gate.	0
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speakest well of fools!	0
If she do, he'll smile and take't for a great favor.	0
Sebastian was my father ; Such a Sebastian was my brother too, So went he suited to his watery tomb.	0
How now!	0
I wish it might, for now I am your fool.	0
Well, let it be., What ho, Malvolio!	0
Does he rave?	0
If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction.	0
Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?	0
What should I think on't?	0
And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.	0
There's another.	0
Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again.	0
What think you of this fool, Malvolio?	0
A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful.	0
Take away the lady.	0
True, madam.	0
You shall hear more.	0
A little, by your favor.	0
Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.	0
I have heard my father name him.	0
He is sad and civil And suits well for a servant with my fortunes.	0
I can write very like my lady your niece : on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands.	0
What would my lord, but that he may not have, Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?	0
Oh, if it prove, Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love!	0
O, welcome, father!	0
What shall we do else?	0
Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house.	0
O time, thou must untangle this, not I.	0
I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.	0
By my troth, sir, no, though it please you to be one of my friends.	0
I am not mad, Sir Topas.	0
Now heaven walks on earth.	0
Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia.	0
Tis not so sweet now as it was before.	0
Beshrew his soul for me!	0
Why, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes, and the clerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony.	0
What shall you ask of me that I'll deny, That honor, saved, may upon asking give?	0
How now, my hearts!	0
No, believe me.	0
But, come what may, I do adore thee so That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.	0
My prayers, minx?	0
I could marry this wench for this device.	0
Art thou mad?	0
How now, mistress?	0
The lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe.	0
Let her hang me.	0
I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade me, for every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me.	0
But it becomes me well enough, does't not?	0
I'll help you, Sir Toby, because we'll be dressed together.	0
But here the lady comes.	0
Not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes, and Nay, my troth, I know not.	0
I could be sad.	0
Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?	0
Why, let her except, before excepted.	0
He's a coward and a coistrel that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o' th' toe like a parish top.	0
The man grows mad.	0
Good madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool.	0
Why, what would you?	0
I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me.	0
Alas, their love may be called appetite, No motion of the liver, but the palate, That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt ; But mine is all as hungry as the sea, And can digest as much.	0
A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than a hare.	0
If that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.	0
So full of shapes is fancy That it alone is high fantastical.	0
"Please smile whenever you're near me, my dearest darling."""	1
You have my word as a gentleman that I'll always be grateful to you.	1
What stunning, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty, but please, tell me if you're the lady of the house, because I've never seen her.	1
Come on, Sir Andrew, there's nothing you can do about it.	1
But you have to.	1
I know a lot about the love women can feel for men.	1
Who are you?	1
I like it too.	1
Who treated you badly?	1
I can't love him.	1
"I'd say I was ""out of my element, "" but that phrase is overused, so I'll say I'm ""out of my air."""	1
Let me enjoy my privacy.	1
Yes, yes.	1
Do you want to go see him?	1
It's about you.	1
Which one of you is the lady of the house?	1
I'm better off because of my enemies, and worse off because of my friends.	1
We only drink toasts to my niece.	1
The first drink makes him a fool, the second makes him crazy, and the third drowns him.	1
You won't be wasting your time, because I really can sing and talk to him about many different kinds of music, so he'll be happy to have me in his service.	1
I mean please go into the house, sir.	1
"Well, you know, ""some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them."" Anyway, I was part of the trick, sir."	1
Taste your legs, sir.	1
What?	1
Wise men who give fools money might get a good reputation, if they keep up regular payments for fourteen years.	1
Malvolio's coming down the path.	1
Are they likely to get dusty?	1
If you tell your lady I'm here to speak with her, and bring her out with you when you come back, you might make me more generous.	1
Next time God sends out a shipment of hair, I hope he gives you a beard!	1
Fabian, bring him here.	1
Madam, I will.	1
Who's she?	1
I didn't find him at the Elephant.	1
I remember.	1
You must have figured out who I am.	1
I told you, someone's at the gate.	1
You speak so highly of fools!	1
And when she does, he'll imagine she's flirting with him.	1
Sebastian was my father's name, and my brother was named Sebastian too.	1
What's going on?	1
I wish I were something better, because right now I'm a big fool.	1
Come here!	1
Is he talking nonsense?	1
If this were a play, I'd complain it was unrealistic.	1
Do you think you've got a couple of fools on your hands here?	1
What's the obvious conclusion from that?	1
And I wouldn't ask for any dowry except for her to play another trick like this one.	1
Here it is.	1
Well then, sing a lullaby to your generosity : it'll nap until I come back.	1
What do you think of this fool, Malvolio?	1
Although many people said she looked like me, she was considered beautiful.	1
Get the lady out of here.	1
It's possible, ma'am.	1
He'll tell you more of the story.	1
A little bit.	1
Keep a little bit of honesty, even if you're afraid.	1
I've heard my father mention him.	1
He's very serious, which is right for someone in mourning like me.	1
I can make my handwriting look just like Lady Olivia's : she	1
What can I give you that you want, my lord, except the one thing you can't have?	1
Oh, if it turns out to be true that he survived, then that storm was kind, and the ocean was full of love!	1
Oh, hello, father!	1
Why not?	1
Stop right now or I'll throw your dagger over the roof.	1
Oh, only time can sort out this mess.	1
Sometimes all I want to do is see plays and go out dancing.	1
Don't say that, unless you want to be one of my friends.	1
I'm not insane, Sir Topas.	1
An angel is walking on earth.	1
Don't compare a woman's love for a man with my love for Olivia.	1
It doesn't sound as sweet as it did before.	1
Damn that Toby!	1
But it has bay windows that are as transparent as stone walls, and the upper windows facing south-north are as clear as coal.	1
What could you possibly ask of me that I wouldn't give you, as long as it didn't damage my honor and self-respect?	1
Hello, my friends!	1
No, not at all.	1
But who cares.	1
My prayers, you hussy?	1
I could marry that Maria for thinking this up.	1
Are you insane?	1
What are you saying, mistress?	1
Lady Strachy married her wardrobe manager.	1
So let her execute me.	1
I know I'm not fooling myself, or letting myself get carried away by my imagination, because every clue points to the fact that Lady Olivia loves me.	1
But my hair looks good anyway, doesn't it?	1
I'll help you, Sir Toby.	1
But here she comes.	1
And the doctors say it's healthy to get up early, I don't know what the doctors say.	1
I could be sad if I wanted to be.	1
May I kiss your feet?	1
Well, she can get used to it.	1
Anyone who refuses to drink to my niece until his brain spins around like a merry-go-round is scum.	1
The man's going crazy.	1
Please let me prove you're a fool.	1
What would you do about it?	1
I'm sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me.	1
It's as all-consuming and insatiable as the sea, and it can swallow as much as the sea can.	1
He's a very dishonest, puny boy, and more cowardly than a rabbit.	1
If that means I don't care about anything, you should disappear right now, since you're nothing.	1
Love is so vivid and fantastical that nothing compares to it.	1
