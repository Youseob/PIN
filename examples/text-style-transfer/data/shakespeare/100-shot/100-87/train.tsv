Tis well blown, lads.	0
Macbeth!, Had I three ears, I'd hear thee.	0
It is a great price for a small vice.	0
Is't possible?	0
Is there more toil?	0
I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a good husband.	0
I do not think it good.	0
Why, here's no crab, and therefore look not sour.	0
Beshrew me but I love her heartily.	0
What shall we hear of this?	0
Welcome to Rome.	0
Treason!	0
Go to thy cold bed and warm thee.	0
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest, For Brutus is an honorable man ; So are they all, all honorable men, Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.	0
No.	0
Not Cassio killed!	0
Oh, yet I do repent me of my fury, That I did kill them.	0
Is't possible?	0
Impudent strumpet!	0
O Isis,'tis impossible.	0
Rest you happy!	0
Not so, neither.	0
All which time Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers To them for you.	0
What, must I come to you With five and twenty, Regan?	0
I am your host.	0
Hush!	0
Marry, if he that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine tragedy.	0
The king's a-bed.	0
I'll leave you, lady.	0
Not for the wide world.	0
Now, where's your master?	0
Dost thou affect her, Claudio?	0
Were they not forced with those that should be ours, We might have met them dareful, beard to beard, And beat them backward home.	0
Let's hear it.	0
Do you hear, masters?	0
Oh, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!	0
Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil.	0
Why, you gave no gold to me!	0
"And maidens call it ""love-in-idleness."" Fetch me that flower."	0
Can not my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights?	0
By our beards (if we had them), thou art.	0
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit, Which, mellowed by the stealing hours of time, Will well become the seat of majesty, And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.	0
Well, I'll break in.	0
Swear by my sword Never to speak of this that you have heard.	0
Now attest That those whom you called fathers did beget you.	0
Many times, madam.	0
If we be not relieved within this hour, We must return to th' court of guard.	0
Jailer, look to him.	0
But life itself, my wife, and all the world Are not with me esteemed above thy life.	0
What he will do with it Heaven knows, not I. I nothing but to please his fantasy.	0
Madam, his majesty doth call for you,, And for your Grace,, and yours, my gracious lords.	0
Set on thy wife to observe.	0
I tell thee, Kate,'twas burnt and dried away.	0
Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.	0
I thank your lordship, you have got me one.	0
A good persuasion.	0
But few of any sort, and none of name.	0
She that doth call me husband, even my soul Doth for a wife abhor.	0
Thy eyes are almost set in thy head.	0
I'll torture him.	0
We are two lions littered in one day, And I the elder and more terrible.	0
What, man, courage yet!	0
What is Thisbe?	0
How fares your grace?	0
Upon them!	0
Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.	0
What's your gracious pleasure?	0
I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thy daughters thy mothers.	0
What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?	0
The messengers!	0
Our general's wife is now the general.	0
Wine loved I deeply, dice dearly, and in woman outparamoured the Turk.	0
He's a good fellow, I can tell you that.	0
So are you, princes English, every one.	0
I'll slit the villain's nose that would have sent me to the jail.	0
Out on thee, seeming!	0
Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower.	0
Go to, go to.	0
They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves For a fair victory.	0
Oh, that I were a man for his sake!	0
But to my mind, though I am native here And to the manner born, it is a custom More honored in the breach than the observance.	0
And I must Rid all the sea of pirates, then, to send Measures of wheat to Rome.	0
Good night, lieutenant, I must to the watch.	0
He knows that you embrace not Antony As you did love, but as you feared him.	0
Oh, I could play the woman with mine eyes And braggart with my tongue!	0
I am famished in his service.	0
Why do you dress me In borrowed robes?	0
Good master, take it not unkindly, pray, That I have been thus pleasant with you both.	0
Brutus killed me.	0
To the vales, And hold our best advantage.	0
But till that time Come not thou near me.	0
Happy, in that we are not overhappy.	0
What, is the fellow mad?	0
They did entreat me to acquaint her of it, But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick, To wish him wrestle with affection And never to let Beatrice know of it.	0
Art thou my son?	0
Therefore, I beseech your Highness pardon me.	0
Half afeard to come.	0
Then let us both be sudden.	0
Farewell, and thanks.	0
There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signor Benedick and her.	0
That was a fine fanfare, boys.	1
If I had three ears I'd listen with all three.	1
It's a big prize for such a small sin.	1
Is this possible?	1
Is there more work to do?	1
I'll do any decent thing, my lord, to help my cousin get a good husband.	1
I don't think it's a good idea.	1
There's no crab-apple here, so don't look sour.	1
God, I'm crazy about her.	1
What do you think will be the result of this storm?	1
Welcome to Rome.	1
Treason!	1
Go play with yourself.	1
With the permission of Brutus and the others, for Brutus is an honorable man ; they are all honorable men, I have come here to speak at Caesar's funeral.	1
No.	1
Cassio's not dead?	1
And yet I still regret the anger that drove me to kill them.	1
Are you kidding?	1
You brazen whore!	1
Oh, Isis, that's impossible.	1
Have a good night!	1
No, I'm not wound up.	1
And I will spend our time apart on my knees, praying for you.	1
Why should I now have to make do with only twenty-five?	1
You are my guests.	1
Quiet!	1
As a matter of fact, if the playwright had played Pyramus and hanged himself with Thisbe's belt, it would have been a very good tragedy.	1
The king's in bed.	1
I'll leave you, lady.	1
I wouldn't do that for the whole wide world.	1
Where's your master?	1
Do you like her, Claudio?	1
If it weren't for the fact that so many of our soldiers revolted and joined them, we could have met them out in front of the castle, man to man, and beaten them back to England.	1
Let's hear it.	1
Do you hear that, men?	1
Send me away, my lord, but don't kill me!	1
You're famous for it.	1
You didn't give me any gold.	1
"Young girls call it ""love-in-idleness."" Bring me that flower."	1
Can't Lord Stanley sleep?	1
By our beards (if we had them), you are a knave.	1
The royal tree has left us other fruit, which, with time, will do just fine on the throne and make us all happy as king, I'm sure.	1
Well, I'm going to break in.	1
Swear by my sword you'll never mention what you've heard.	1
Prove that the men you call your fathers did truly conceive you.	1
Many times, madam.	1
If we aren't relieved in an hour, we have to return to our barracks.	1
Jailer, keep an eye on him.	1
But life itself, my wife, and the whole world aren't more valuable to me than your life is.	1
Heaven knows what he's going to do with it.	1
Madam, his majesty asks for you, and for you, Duke of Gloucester, and for you, my noble lords.	1
Tell your wife to watch her.	1
And I'm telling you it was burnt and dried out.	1
These lovers are saying some strange things, Theseus.	1
I think I've found one already, thanks to you, my lord.	1
That's the right attitude.	1
Not many, and no one important.	1
That woman who claims I am her husband, I loathe her in my soul.	1
Your eyes look like they've sunk into your head.	1
I'll torture him.	1
We're two lions born on the same day in the same litter, and I'm the older and more terrible.	1
Keep up your courage, man!	1
Who's Thisbe?	1
How are you, your highness?	1
Let's go!	1
Go to sleep, and I will wrap my arms around you.	1
What do you want?	1
I've been singing ever since you made your daughters into your mothers by giving them all your power.	1
Why should I be afraid of your judgment when I haven't done anything wrong?	1
Call the messengers!	1
Othello's wife has a lot of influence now.	1
I loved wine and gambling, and had more women than a Turkish sultan keeps in his harem.	1
He's a good fellow, I can tell you that much.	1
You are welcome here, as are all of you English princes.	1
No, I'll slit the nose of the villain who would have sent me to jail.	1
Curse you for your false appearances!	1
The king isn't the one sending you to the Tower, Clarence.	1
Go on.	1
They're retreating, sir, and our superiority indicates a clear victory.	1
Oh, if only I were a man!	1
But though I was born here and should consider that tradition part of my own heritage, I think it would be better to ignore it than practice it.	1
In return, I must clear the sea of pirates and send tributes of wheat to Rome.	1
Good night, lieutenant.	1
He knows that you didn't embrace Antony because you loved him, but because you feared him.	1
I could go on weeping like a woman and bragging about how I will avenge them!	1
He's starving me to death.	1
Why are you giving me his title?	1
I hope, sir, that you're not angry that I've been equally attentive to you both!	1
Brutus killed me.	1
Let's take up the best positions we can in the valleys.	1
Well, until that time, don't come near me.	1
Happy that we're not too happy, lucky in being not too lucky.	1
What, is the man insane?	1
They did want me to tell her, but I persuaded them that, if they truly loved Benedick, they would try to get him to battle his emotions and keep Beatrice in the dark.	1
Are you my son?	1
Therefore, I beg your Highness, pardon me.	1
He's afraid to come in.	1
Let's act quickly.	1
Farewell, and thanks.	1
Benedick and Beatrice have been waging a war of wits between themselves.	1
