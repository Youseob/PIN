Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers ; Then well one more may fair Bianca have.	0
Do but look up.	0
Fathers that wear rags Do make their children blind.	0
You hear the suit.	0
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.	0
I know him well.	0
The murmuring surge That on th' unnumbered idle pebbles chafes Can not be heard so high.	0
If Signor Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.	0
It is the lady that Pyramus must love.	0
But not with such familiar instances Nor with such free and friendly conference As he hath used of old.	0
Why then,'tis good to be a post.	0
Thou must know,'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honor ; Mine honor, it.	0
Let not the heavens hear these telltale women Rail on the Lord's anointed.	0
I did her wrong, Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?	0
Howl, howl, howl, howl!	0
There was none such in the army of any sort.	0
No disgrace Shall fall you for refusing him at sea, Being prepared for land.	0
If you do not, if I be left alone, Now, by mine honor, which is yet mine own, I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.	0
Had all his hairs been lives My great revenge had stomach for them all.	0
What think you on't?	0
E'en so, my lord.	0
Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou meet'st the fellow.	0
Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catched in this business.	0
Tomorrow dinner, then?	0
Out of my sight!	0
Make all the money thou canst.	0
Thou strik'st not me,'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.	0
"Are they ""informed"" of this?"	0
She wished she had not heard it, yet she wished That heaven had made her such a man.	0
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us, That covenants may be kept on either hand.	0
A dream itself is but a shadow.	0
A calendar, a calendar!	0
Indeed he is not fit.	0
What, is the jay more precious than the lark Because his feathers are more beautiful?	0
I pray you, sir, hold your hand.	0
These ducats pawn I for my father here.	0
That's mercy, but too much security.	0
Whither are you going?	0
I have heard too much, and your words and performances are no kin together.	0
With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?	0
Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think you do not use me with that affability as, in discretion, you ought to use me, look you, being as good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of war and in the derivation of my birth and in other particularities.	0
Sir John Falstaff.	0
I dare damnation.	0
Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell.	0
No, lad.	0
But now in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the dukes he values most, for equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either's moiety.	0
A howling monster, a drunken monster.	0
I stay too long from her.	0
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.	0
No, I am a Welshman.	0
By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.	0
Your brother the Bastard is fled from Messina.	0
All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience.	0
These words are not mine.	0
Speak.	0
It is a man's office, but not yours.	0
A play there is, my lord, some ten words long, Which is as brief as I have known a play.	0
What mean you, Caesar?	0
Most like a gentleman.	0
We are three of them.	0
Shall, Antipholus, Even in the spring of love thy love-springs rot?	0
Ay, you would beg, Were you in my distress.	0
And friends with Caesar.	0
So Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.	0
So are those crisped snaky golden locks Which maketh such wanton gambols with the wind, Upon supposed fairness, often known To be the dowry of a second head, The skull that bred them in the sepulcher.	0
Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.	0
True.	0
May be she doth but counterfeit.	0
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.	0
Pray, what do you think is his name?	0
Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates?	0
I could do more to do Antonius good, But'twould offend him, and in his offense Should my performance perish.	0
Is ink and paper ready?	0
He is enamored on Hero.	0
What, what, good cheer!	0
I do serve you in this business.	0
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?	0
What's the news with thee?	0
More wonderful, when angels are so angry.	0
All hail, Macbeth!	0
Women's gentle brain Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention, Such Ethiop words, blacker in their effect Than in their countenance.	0
What would my potent master?	0
Yet that is but a crushed necessity, Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.	0
Go to your rest.	0
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit.	0
Yea, marry, that's the eftest way., Let the watch come forth.	0
After so long grief, such nativity!	0
Mark his condition and the event.	0
Dear, they durst not, So dear the love my people bore me, nor set A mark so bloody on the business, but With colors fairer painted their foul ends.	0
Now counterfeit to swoon, why, now fall down ; Or if thou canst not, Oh, for shame, for shame, Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.	0
Here's a change indeed!	0
And so he fell.	0
Noble Antony, not sickness should detain me.	0
To be a well-favored man is the gift of fortune, but to write and read comes by nature.	0
Thither he Will come to know his destiny.	0
I have been your tenant and your father's tenant these fourscore years.	0
I'll see thee hanged on Sunday first.	0
By two o'clock I will be with thee again.	0
Swart like my shoe, but her face nothing like so clean kept.	0
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods, Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.	0
The beautiful Helen of Troy had a thousand suitors.	1
Just look.	1
Fathers who wear rags Make their children neglect them.	1
You hear the charges.	1
She was too attached to her filthy marriage ever to do a thing like that!	1
I know him well.	1
Up here you can't even hear the waves crashing against the rocks.	1
Well, even if he is her father, I'm sure she wouldn't want to have the head of the old man on her shoulders!	1
Thisbe is the lady Pyramus is in love with.	1
He received me with courtesy and sufficient respect, but not with affection, nor with as much open and friendly conversation as he once greeted me.	1
In that case it's good to be a post.	1
You should know that to me, profit isn't more important than honor, but the other way around.	1
Don't let the heavens hear these chattery women abuse the Lord's anointed king.	1
I was wrong to her, Do you know how an oyster makes its shell?	1
Howl, howl, howl, howl!	1
There was no Signior Montanto in our army.	1
Refusing to fight him at sea won't disgrace you.	1
If you don't, if I'm left alone, I swear I'll have that legal expert as my bedfellow.	1
If he had as many lives as he's got hairs on his head, I would've killed them all in revenge.	1
What do you think about it?	1
Just as bad, my lord.	1
Then keep your vow, fellow, when you meet the man.	1
Be careful, Signior Baptista, lest you be made the dupe in this business.	1
Then tomorrow at dinner?	1
Get out of my sight!	1
Raise all the money you can.	1
You won't be striking me down, but defeating Caesar.	1
Did you inform them of that?	1
She said she wished she hadn't heard it, but she also wished there was a man like me for her.	1
Let's have explicit contracts drawn up to ensure that both sides keep their promises.	1
But a dream itself is just a shadow.	1
We need a calendar!	1
Indeed, he's not right for this.	1
I mean, is the jay more precious than the lark because his feather is more beautiful?	1
Please, sir, restrain yourself.	1
I want to use this money to set my father free.	1
That's merciful but a bit careless.	1
Where are you going?	1
Your words and actions don't match up.	1
How did he try to persuade you to love him?	1
Captain Macmorris, if you take my words in some way other than how they were meant, see, I'll have to think you're not treating me with the good will you ought to, see, since I am as good a man as yourself, both in the practice of war and in my country of origin and in other respects.	1
Sir John Falstaff.	1
Please, come with me.	1
But I paid attention to where Cupid's arrow fell.	1
No, son.	1
But the way he's divided the kingdom recently, nobody can tell which of the dukes he favors more.	1
A loud-mouthed, drunken monster.	1
We're wasting time here.	1
So, I agree with noble Buckingham, only a few should go to meet the prince.	1
No, I am a Welshman.	1
Really, he's very witty, and full of wise sayings.	1
Your brother Don John the Bastard has run away from Messina.	1
He can't bear his grief and so he's losing his mind.	1
You're not answering my question.	1
Tell me.	1
It's a job meant for a man, but not you.	1
It's a play about ten words long, which is the shortest play I've ever heard of.	1
What are you doing, Caesar?	1
Yes, in a very gentlemanly way.	1
We're three of them.	1
Is the building of your love already in ruins?	1
Yes, you would beg, if you were in my position.	1
And he's friendly with Caesar.	1
So, by Christ, I'll cut off your head.	1
Curly golden hair moves so nicely in the wind and makes a woman beautiful.	1
Demetrius loves her, and he doesn't love you.	1
True.	1
Maybe she's just pretending.	1
As for me, I welcome my good luck with sadness.	1
Why, what do you imagine his name to be?	1
Why does he talk like that to a girl he can't stand?	1
I could do more to help Antony, but to do so would insult him.	1
Is my ink and paper ready?	1
He is in love with Hero.	1
Cheer up!	1
I'll help you through this business.	1
Have you heard anything to the contrary?	1
What's new with you?	1
It's even stranger when an angel is so angry.	1
All hail, Macbeth!	1
No, a woman's gentle brain could never have come up with such crude expressions and even harsher meanings.	1
What does my powerful master wish for?	1
But that is a false conclusion, since we have locks to keep our valuables safe and clever traps to catch little thieves.	1
Go relax now.	1
I don't want to kill you before you've readied your soul.	1
Yes, good idea ; that's the	1
After such a long period of grief, we will have such a celebration!	1
Think about that, and about what followed afterward.	1
The answer, my dear, is that they didn't dare, because the people of Milan loved me too much.	1
Faint, fall down, if you don't, then you're lying about my eyes being murderers.	1
Things have certainly changed!	1
And so he fainted.	1
Noble Antony, even illness couldn't keep me away.	1
To be good-looking is a matter of luck, but to read and write is a natural gift.	1
Macbeth will go there to learn his destiny.	1
I've rented land from you and your father for eighty years.	1
She has the patience of a I'll see you hanged on Sunday first!	1
I'll be back here with you by two o'clock.	1
It's dark, like my shoe.	1
Let's carve him up like a dish fit for the gods, not chop him up like a carcass fit for dogs.	1
