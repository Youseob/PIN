I can write very like my lady your niece : on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands.	0
Marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren.	0
I'll go another way to work with him.	0
Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.	0
But this is from my commission.	0
If one knight give a, Would you have a love song or a song of good life?	0
Alas, that they are so, To die even when they to perfection grow!	0
Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing, Though, I confess, much like the character.	0
His eyes were set at eight i' the morning.	0
I beseech you, what manner of man is he?	0
By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o' nights.	0
Why, this is evident to any formal capacity.	0
Get you to your lord.	0
Sir Topas!	0
Make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate.	0
I think not so, my lord.	0
In my stars I am above thee, but be not afraid of greatness.	0
I would exult, man.	0
Tis with him in standing water, between boy and man.	0
His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.	0
I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry.	0
But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valor, and drive the gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity.	0
Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's a-hungry, to challenge him the field and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him.	0
God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your folly!	0
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speakest well of fools!	0
Tell me your mind.	0
Why, thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad.	0
Though I struck him first, yet it's no matter for that.	0
Give us the place alone.	0
If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors, you are welcome to the house.	0
Sweet lady, ho, ho.	0
In faith, they are as true of heart as we.	0
We'll whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.	0
O time, thou must untangle this, not I.	0
How say you to that, Malvolio?	0
Do not then walk too open.	0
An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again.	0
I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all, and he gives me the stuck-in with such a mortal motion, that it is inevitable.	0
He takes on him to understand so much, and therefore comes to speak with you.	0
With drinking healths to my niece.	0
Good.	0
Fare thee well.	0
"Some are born great, """	0
Malvolio's coming down this walk.	0
Ay, good fool.	0
Fie, thou dishonest Satan!	0
Nay, good Sir Toby.	0
Marian, I say!	0
Not too fast!	0
He will find it comes from a clodpole.	0
Tell me that.	0
I'll do my best To woo your lady, Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.	0
I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me.	0
I could be sad.	0
Oh, that I served that lady And might not be delivered to the world, Till I had made mine own occasion mellow, What my estate is.	0
Therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.	0
Why do you speak to me?	0
Methinks his words do from such passion fly, That he believes himself.	0
This does make some obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering, but what of that?	0
Good, i' faith.	0
He is sad and civil And suits well for a servant with my fortunes.	0
O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.	0
Lie thou there (throwing down a letter), for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.	0
"Andrew Aguecheek"""	0
Here comes the Countess.	0
Open't, and read it.	0
Good night, Penthesilea.	0
He hath known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.	0
Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes.	0
Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born Not three hours' travel from this very place.	0
Ay, husband.	0
There is a fair behavior in thee, captain, And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character.	0
If the heavens had been pleased, would we had so ended!	0
No, sir, it is legs and thighs.	0
No, sir, I live by the church.	0
Fare thee well.	0
How is't with you?	0
Were we not born under Taurus?	0
My lord and master loves you.	0
Good fool, help me to some light and some paper.	0
There lies your way, due west.	0
You know, he brought me out o' favor with my lady about a bear-baiting here.	0
Here, wear this jewel for me.	0
Is't possible?	0
A gentleman?	0
Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your Ladyship.	0
It doth not fit me.	0
Go shake your ears!	0
He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that they come from my niece, and that she's in love with him.	0
Why, let her except, before excepted.	0
What is to be said to him, lady?	0
Do thy office.	0
Save you, gentleman.	0
Art thou mad?	0
Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains.	0
He started one poor heart of mine in thee.	0
A contagious breath.	0
To one of your receiving Enough is shown.	0
Go call him hither.	0
I know your favor well, Though now you have no sea-cap on your head., Take him away.	0
I can make my handwriting look just like Lady Olivia's : she	1
But oops, when I let go of your hand, I let go of the biggest joke of all.	1
I'll get back at him another way.	1
Why, he has an income of three thousand ducats a year.	1
But that's not part of what I'm supposed to say.	1
Would you rather hear a love song or a song about the good life?	1
It's too bad their beauty fades right when it reaches perfection!	1
I'm sorry, Malvolio, but this isn't my writing, though I admit it looks like mine.	1
His eyes started glazing over around eight in the morning.	1
What kind of man is he?	1
For God's sake, Sir Toby, you've got to come home earlier at night.	1
Why, anyone can see what this means.	1
Go back to your lord.	1
Sir Topas!	1
Make him think you're Sir Topas the priest.	1
I don't think so, my lord.	1
By my birth I rank above you, but don't be afraid of my greatness.	1
I'll be thrilled.	1
He's somewhere between boy and man.	1
He's really taken this prank to heart.	1
I'd give half my dowry to keep anything bad from happening to him.	1
But I'll deliver Sir Andrew's challenge by word of mouth, describing Sir Andrew as courageous in battle and convincing the young gentleman that Sir Andrew is furious, impetuous, and a skilled fighter (he'll believe me because he's young).	1
I could challenge him to a duel and then not show up.	1
I hope you go senile soon, sir, so you can become a more foolish fool!	1
You speak so highly of fools!	1
Tell me what you want.	1
You've made him so delusional he'll go crazy when he learns the truth.	1
It doesn't matter that I hit him first.	1
Everyone, please leave us alone for a moment.	1
If you can shape up, you're welcome to stay in the house.	1
Hello, sweet lady.	1
Actually, their hearts are as sensitive and loyal as ours are.	1
We've got some words of wisdom to mull over.	1
Oh, only time can sort out this mess.	1
What do you say to that, Malvolio?	1
Then don't make yourself too conspicuous.	1
If you let her go this easily, Sir Andrew, you don't deserve to ever use your sword again.	1
I had a round with him, and his sword thrust is so deadly that you can't even duck out of the way.	1
He claimed he knew that, and that's why he's come to speak with you.	1
We only drink toasts to my niece.	1
Good.	1
Good-bye.	1
"Some are born great, """	1
Malvolio's coming down the path.	1
Yes, good fool.	1
You should be ashamed of yourself, Satan, you liar!	1
No, good Sir Toby.	1
Maria!	1
Ah, no.	1
He'll just think an idiot wrote it.	1
Tell me that.	1
I'll do my best to make this lady love you.	1
Please, fool, go away.	1
I could be sad if I wanted to be.	1
I wish I could work for that lady!	1
So listen up, princess.	1
Why are you talking like this?	1
I don't believe it.	1
These crisscrossing laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit, but who cares?	1
That's true.	1
He's very serious, which is right for someone in mourning like me.	1
Oh, Antonio, I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble.	1
Now, you lie there on the path.	1
"Andrew Aguecheek"""	1
Ah, the countess is coming!	1
Open it and read it.	1
Good night, you amazing woman, you.	1
He's only known you for three days, but he's already treating you like a close friend.	1
Nothing can come between me and the fulfillment of all my hopes.	1
I was born and raised less than three hours from here.	1
Yes, husband.	1
You seem to be a good person, captain, and although people who look beautiful are often corrupt inside, I believe that you have a beautiful mind to go with your good looks and manners.	1
If God had been willing, I wish we had died in the same hour too!	1
No, the legs and thighs.	1
No, sir, I live by the church.	1
Well then, goodbye.	1
How are you?	1
Weren't we both born under Taurus?	1
My lord loves you.	1
Be a nice fool and help me find a candle and some paper.	1
I wish you all the best.	1
You know, he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when I arranged a bear-baiting here.	1
Here, take this piece of jewelry.	1
Is it possible?	1
A gentleman?	1
You've shut me up in a dark room and given your drunken cousin authority over me, but I'm as sane as you are.	1
You're right.	1
Go and wiggle your ears!	1
He'll think these letters are from Olivia and that she's in love with him.	1
Well, she can get used to it.	1
What can I say to him, lady?	1
Do your job.	1
Hello, sir.	1
Are you insane?	1
I'll never believe a madman until I can see his brains.	1
He made my heart leap for you.	1
His breath stinks.	1
For someone as intelligent as you the situation must be clear enough.	1
Ask him in here.	1
I recognize your face perfectly, even without a sailor's cap on your head., Take him away.	1
