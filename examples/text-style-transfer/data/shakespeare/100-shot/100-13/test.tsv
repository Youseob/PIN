No, sir.	0
Saw you him today?	0
Marry, I remember it well.	0
Find them out whose names are written here?	0
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, On Thursday next be married to this county.	0
That shall she.	0
Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I.	0
He is hid at Lawrence' cell.	0
A plague o' both your houses!	0
If they do see thee they will murder thee.	0
Let's talk.	0
Rest you merry!	0
Go ask his name., If he be married.	0
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shrift., Come, madam, let's away.	0
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years, And she was weaned, I never shall forget it, Of all the days of the year, upon that day.	0
Ay, forsooth.	0
A pack of blessings light upon thy back, Happiness courts thee in her best array,	0
Oh, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.	0
What cursed foot wanders this way tonight To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?	0
Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man.	0
I am none of his skains-mates.	0
Farewell, my coz.	0
Beshrew my very heart, I think you are happy in this second match, For it excels your first.	0
Well, Susan is with God.	0
They are free men, but I am banished.	0
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks.	0
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine, Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.	0
Wilt thou be gone?	0
Then I defy you, stars!	0
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear, So soon forsaken?	0
I will come again.	0
How now, who calls?	0
Come, come away.	0
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?	0
Madam, I am not well.	0
Here, here will I remain With worms that are thy chamber maids.	0
Ay, let the county take you in your bed.	0
I pray thee, hold thy peace.	0
Tis well thou art not fish.	0
My master's.	0
Stay, then.	0
His fault concludes but what the law should end, The life of Tybalt.	0
Stay, Tybalt, stay!	0
Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!	0
"It is ""music with her silver sound"" because musicians have no gold for sounding."	0
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.	0
A jealous hood, a jealous hood!	0
You have dancing shoes With nimble soles.	0
I hate the word, As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.	0
Wherefore art thou Romeo?	0
I'll not to bed tonight.	0
The date is out of such prolixity.	0
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help, Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this knife I'll help it presently.	0
Yea, noise?	0
But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.	0
Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes.	0
Let him alone.	0
O calm dishonourable, vile submission!	0
And when I shall die, Take him and cut him out in little stars, And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the garish sun.	0
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now To murder, murder our solemnity?	0
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!	0
I'll to him.	0
Who knocks so hard?	0
What hast thou found?	0
O Friar, the damned use that word in hell.	0
Will you go to them?	0
How sweet is love itself possessed When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!	0
Even such delight Among fresh fennel buds shall you this night Inherit at my house.	0
What a man are you?	0
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.	0
Tis not to me she speaks.	0
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence' cell, And gave him what becomed love I might, Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.	0
Oh, so light a foot Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.	0
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, It may be thought we held him carelessly, Being our kinsman, if we revel much.	0
This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house Is empty on the back of Montague, And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom.	0
I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.	0
I have.	0
Alack the day!	0
Answer me like men.	0
Why, such is love's transgression.	0
His son was but a ward two years ago.	0
Think upon these gone.	0
It was.	0
Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish!	0
Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo.	0
Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose.	0
Younger than she are happy mothers made.	0
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.	0
Brother, ho!	0
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?	0
"Yet I can not choose but laugh To think it should leave crying and say ""ay."" And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone, A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly."	0
It is written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets.	0
The second cock hath crowed.	0
I strike quickly, being moved.	0
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.	0
Commend me to thy mistress.	0
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone.	0
Scurvy knave!	0
Sweet, so would I.	0
My child, my only life, Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!, Help, help!	0
Therefore be patient.	0
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting.	0
Let me alone.	0
Where should she be?	0
He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb.	0
I thought all for the best.	0
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?	0
Romeo!	0
Raise up the Montagues.	0
Well, peace be with you, sir.	0
The strangers all are gone.	0
A great suspicion.	0
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo!	0
A braggart, a rogue, a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic!	0
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead, And Paris too.	0
You will not then?	0
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love, And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next, But, soft!	0
Was I with you there for the goose?	0
The ground is bloody., Search about the churchyard.	0
She speaks, yet she says nothing.	0
One fairer than my love?	0
Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, Nurse.	0
Warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.	0
How is it with her?	0
And so, good Capulet, which name I tender As dearly as my own, be satisfied.	0
Am I like such a fellow?	0
Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain!	0
Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or I'll cry a match.	0
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.	0
Prates too., What say you, James Soundpost?	0
A thousand times the worse to want thy light.	0
O happy dagger, This is thy sheath.	0
And to sink in it, should you burthen love, Too great oppression for a tender thing.	0
My invocation Is fair and honest.	0
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.	0
The earth, that's nature's mother, is her tomb.	0
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.	0
What is the matter?	0
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?	0
Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.	0
Clubs, bills, and partisans!	0
What unaccustomed cause procures her hither?	0
Hence will I to my ghostly friar's close cell, His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.	0
Where is she?	0
I drink to thee.	0
Thou, why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.	0
Now, good sweet Nurse, O Lord, why look'st thou sad?	0
I spoke with his man.	0
Is it e'en so?	0
I saw no man use you at his pleasure.	0
Can heaven be so envious?	0
I dare not, sir.	0
Serve God.	0
Thou dost not mark me.	0
Every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave.	0
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face!	0
I will bite my thumb at them, which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.	0
And so did I.	0
Make haste, I say.	0
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine.	0
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.	0
O God's lady dear, Are you so hot?	0
By'r Lady, thirty years.	0
It makes me mad.	0
As I discern, It burneth in the Capels' monument.	0
Now I'll tell you without asking.	0
Farewell.	0
Therefore, farewell.	0
What's this?	0
What if this mixture do not work at all?	0
No.	0
Even so lies she, Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.	0
Wherefore storm you so?	0
This is well.	0
O noble prince, I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.	0
Hast thou met with him?	0
O blessed, blessed night!	0
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import Some misadventure.	0
She was too good for me.	0
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.	0
Well, sir.	0
The Prince will doom thee death If thou art taken.	0
So thrive my soul, A thousand times good night!	0
And too soon marred are those so early made.	0
Death is my son-in-law.	0
Come forth, thou fearful man.	0
The day is broke.	0
Where is my father and my mother, Nurse?	0
Wisely and slow.	0
Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear'st of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.	0
By my holy order, I thought thy disposition better tempered.	0
My child is yet a stranger in the world.	0
Saint Francis be my speed!	0
Tis twenty year till then.	0
Give me leave awhile.	0
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun, Did murder her, as that name's cursed hand Murdered her kinsman.	0
What noise is here?	0
Is she not proud?	0
What will you give us?	0
Groan!	0
Give me those flowers.	0
And what to?	0
"Romeo, he cries aloud, ""Hold, friends!"	0
What noise is this?	0
I am sped.	0
As I did sleep under this yew tree here, I dreamt my master and another fought, And that my master slew him.	0
Dead art thou!	0
I know not.	0
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love, An hour but married, Tybalt murdered, Doting like me, and like me banished, Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair And fall upon the ground, as I do now, Taking the measure of an unmade grave.	0
Oh, what learning is!	0
Montague!	0
Where the devil should this Romeo be?	0
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.	0
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.	0
Well, think of marriage now.	0
My nyas?	0
Away with the joint-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the plate.	0
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uproused by some distemperature.	0
You say well.	0
But new struck nine.	0
Give me thy torch, boy.	0
Fear comes upon me.	0
Ay, those attires are best.	0
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?	0
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily, That we have had no time to move our daughter.	0
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night, Like softest music to attending ears!	0
Let them affright thee.	0
I will bring you thither.	0
Where I have learned me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests, and am enjoined By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here To beg your pardon.	0
Marry, come up, I trow.	0
What sayst thou, my dear Nurse?	0
On Thursday, sir?	0
Good Romeo, hide thyself.	0
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.	0
Or did I dream it so?	0
Take thou some new infection to thy eye, And the rank poison of the old will die.	0
It did, it did.	0
Where is my mother?	0
But where hast thou been, then?	0
That ever I should live to see thee dead.	0
This night I hold an old accustomed feast, Whereto I have invited many a guest Such as I love.	0
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.	0
Have I thought long to see this morning's face, And doth it give me such a sight as this?	0
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?	0
That is because the traitor murderer lives.	0
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.	0
I drew to part them.	0
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender Of my child's love.	0
Oh, in this love, you love your child so ill That you run mad, seeing that she is well.	0
"Yea, "" quoth my husband, ""Fall'st upon thy face?"	0
I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.	0
Tomorrow will I send.	0
Where is my lord?	0
Meantime I writ to Romeo, That he should hither come as this dire night, To help to take her from her borrowed grave, Being the time the potion's force should cease.	0
Love's heralds should be thoughts, Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams, Driving back shadows over louring hills.	0
This shall determine that.	0
Villain am I none.	0
Life, living, all is Death's.	0
Marry, I will, and this is wisely done.	0
I am the greatest, able to do least, Yet most suspected, as the time and place Doth make against me, of this direful murder.	0
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?	0
This sight of death is as a bell, That warns my old age to a sepulcher.	0
Life and these lips have long been separated.	0
I am for you.	0
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.	0
"Yea, "" quoth he, ""Dost thou fall upon thy face?"	0
If love be blind, love can not hit the mark.	0
You shall have none ill, sir, for I'll try if they can lick their fingers.	0
Long love doth so.	0
O Juliet, I already know thy grief.	0
Then have at you with my wit.	0
Is my father well?	0
Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.	0
And stay, good Nurse.	0
Some grief shows much of love, But much of grief shows still some want of wit.	0
And sayst thou yet that exile is not death?	0
So shalt thou show me friendship.	0
Oh, here Will I set up my everlasting rest, And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh.	0
"That ""banished, "" that one word ""banished"" Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts."	0
My naked weapon is out.	0
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.	0
What can he say in this?	0
And is it not well served into a sweet goose?	0
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it, And yet I would it were to give again.	0
And she as much in love, her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere.	0
Spakest thou of Juliet?	0
Benedicite.	0
To our house.	0
Ay, ay, the cords.	0
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife, And all those twenty could but kill one life.	0
Whither?	0
Her eye in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night.	0
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither., Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar!	0
Art thou gone so, love, lord?	0
What, ho?	0
Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand That I might touch that cheek!	0
Come hither, Nurse.	0
I'll send to one in Mantua, Where that same banished runagate doth live, Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company.	0
What of that?	0
"Oh, the people in the street cry ""Romeo, "" Some ""Juliet, "" and some ""Paris, "" and all run With open outcry toward our monument."	0
Let me stand here till thou remember it.	0
Howling attends it.	0
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?	0
Whence come you?	0
Oh, he is even in my mistress' case, Just in her case.	0
Soft!	0
I would forget it fain, But oh, it presses to my memory, Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds.	0
A cup, closed in my true love's hand?	0
What should it be that is so shrieked abroad?	0
Have you delivered to her our decree?	0
Both with an Ah, mocker, that's the dog's name.	0
This doth not so, for she divideth us.	0
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.	0
I neither know it nor can learn of him.	0
Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.	0
We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard's side.	0
Yet I will adventure.	0
Tut, I have lost myself.	0
Where is my Romeo?	0
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?	0
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.	0
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news, Since you did leave it for my office, sir.	0
Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.	0
What day is this?	0
I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement.	0
She's cold.	0
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.	0
I'll find out your man, And he shall signify from time to time Every good hap to you that chances here.	0
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.	0
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?	0
If I had, my weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you.	0
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.	0
Have at thee, coward!	0
O, teach me how I should forget to think!	0
Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.	0
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence's cell.	0
Hast thou slain Tybalt?	0
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news.	0
Down with the Montagues!	0
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet, Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.	0
God in heaven bless her!	0
"I am not I if there be such an Or those eyes shut that makes thee answer ""ay."" If he be slain, say ""ay, "" or if not, ""no."" Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe."	0
Why, she is within.	0
He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall.	0
Farewell.	0
O brother Montague, give me thy hand.	0
Make haste, make haste, sirrah.	0
Is't good or bad?	0
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?	0
Draw thy tool!	0
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand, and'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.	0
Peter, stay at the gate.	0
Let me be put to death.	0
I am afeard, Being in night, all this is but a dream, Too flattering sweet to be substantial.	0
Despised, distressed, hated, martyred, killed!	0
I will follow you.	0
My dearest cousin and my dearer lord?	0
Smatter with your gossips, go.	0
And why, my Lady Wisdom?	0
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone.	0
Nurse, where's my daughter?	0
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears.	0
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft To soar with his light feathers, and so bound, I can not bound a pitch above dull woe.	0
Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter?	0
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail Tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep, Then he dreams of another benefice.	0
Dost thou love me?	0
Sweet-heart!	0
I am hurt.	0
Madam, I am here.	0
Borrow Cupid's wings And soar with them above a common bound.	0
What misadventure is so early up That calls our person from our morning rest?	0
Lie thou there.	0
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily.	0
They stumble that run fast.	0
One knocks.	0
What must be shall be.	0
One kiss, and I'll descend.	0
Your mother.	0
I hear some noise.	0
I have it, And soundly too.	0
Send thy man away.	0
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well-appareled April on the heel Of limping winter treads.	0
A sick man in sadness makes his will, A word ill urged to one that is so ill.	0
Take thou that.	0
Tybalt's death Was woe enough, if it had ended there.	0
Her lord is come.	0
Lady, come from that nest Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.	0
O rude unthankfulness!	0
Up.	0
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.	0
Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.	0
What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night, So stumblest on my counsel?	0
Conceit, more rich in matter than in words, Brags of his substance, not of ornament.	0
I will be brief, for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale.	0
A plague o' both your houses!	0
What with a torch!	0
I serve as good a man as you.	0
God'i' good e'en.	0
Susan and she, God rest all Christian souls!, Were of an age.	0
Twas no need, I trow, To bid me trudge.	0
Away, Tybalt.	0
Do you not see that I am out of breath?	0
How oddly thou repliest!	0
How sound is she asleep!	0
Why dost thou wring thy hands?	0
Young son, it argues a distempered head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.	0
Let us take the law of our sides.	0
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life, Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.	0
Come, civil night, Thou sober-suited matron, all in black, And learn me how to lose a winning match Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.	0
I nursed her daughter that you talked withal.	0
Anon!	0
Thy Juliet is alive, For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead, There art thou happy.	0
Young Romeo is it?	0
Ah, where's my man?, Give me some aqua vitae., These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.	0
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.	0
Go waken Juliet.	0
We can not be here and there too.	0
Oh, mickle is the powerful grace that lies In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities.	0
Well get you gone.	0
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?	0
Ay me, what news?	0
"Proud, "" and ""I thank you, "" and ""I thank you not, "" And yet ""not proud""?"	0
Nurse?	0
No,'tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door, but'tis enough,'twill serve.	0
Here lies the county slain, And Juliet bleeding, warm and newly dead, Who here hath lain these two days buried., Go, tell the Prince.	0
What wilt thou tell her, Nurse?	0
Well, in that hit you miss.	0
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?	0
You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for, in the great chamber.	0
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye, The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry, I must upfill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.	0
That last is true.	0
Doth she not count her blessed, Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bride?	0
Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!	0
Now God in heaven bless thee!	0
But where unbruised youth with unstuffed brain Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.	0
Why, no.	0
My back a' t' other side.	0
Young men's love then lies Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.	0
I'll be with thee straight.	0
Here comes the lady.	0
This, by his voice, should be a Montague., What, dares the slave Come hither, covered with an antic face, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?	0
O flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified!	0
Tonight she is mewed up to her heaviness.	0
Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.	0
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!	0
Why, may one ask?	0
Good night.	0
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.	0
We shall be much unfurnished for this time.	0
Thou shalt be loggerhead., Good faith,'tis day.	0
The most you sought was her promotion, For'twas your heaven she should be advanced.	0
I can tell you, but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him.	0
Before and apace.	0
What is it else?	0
God mark thee to his grace!	0
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?	0
All men call thee fickle.	0
I was hurt under your arm.	0
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness, And fear'st to die?	0
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much.	0
Good morrow, Father.	0
"Did you ne'er hear say, ""Two may keep counsel, putting one away""?"	0
O lamentable day!	0
Thy wild acts denote The unreasonable fury of a beast.	0
O most wicked fiend!	0
Fie, how my bones ache!	0
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what.	0
And all the better is it for the maid.	0
A madness most discreet, A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.	0
Oh, that she knew she were!	0
How doth my lady?	0
O heavens!	0
More light and light it grows.	0
Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company.	0
I can read.	0
Hie to high fortune!	0
Madam, good night.	0
Well, you have made a simple choice.	0
Nay, that's not so.	0
God ye good morrow, gentlemen.	0
O cousin, cousin!	0
And when I do, I swear It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate, Rather than Paris.	0
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl, For here we need it not.	0
Romeo slew him ; he slew Mercutio.	0
Tis almost morning.	0
I am peppered, I warrant, for this world.	0
O God, I have an ill-divining soul.	0
Let me be ta'en.	0
By my troth, it is well said.	0
Tis more,'tis more.	0
Hark you, sir.	0
What is her mother?	0
How long hath he been there?	0
Ah, my back, my back!	0
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.	0
These times of woe afford no time to woo.	0
Couple it with something.	0
My daughter he hath wedded.	0
Go with me to the vault.	0
My fan, Peter.	0
Oh, no.	0
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous, Where is your mother?	0
I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.	0
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face.	0
Give me my sin again.	0
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.	0
"And, pretty fool, it stinted and said ""ay."" Enough of this."	0
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.	0
Out upon you!	0
Do as I bid thee, go.	0
Two, two, a shirt and a smock.	0
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.	0
Go tell him of this.	0
What, not a word?	0
Mine shall be spent When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.	0
Madam, in happy time, what day is that?	0
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.	0
Was ever book containing such vile matter So fairly bound?	0
To supper?	0
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.	0
How well my comfort is revived by this!	0
Indeed, I never shall be satisfied With Romeo, till I behold him, dead, Is my poor heart for a kinsman vexed.	0
Be brisk 0awhile, and the longer liver take all.	0
A gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.	0
What wouldst thou have with me?	0
Nay, I'll conjure too!	0
Come, night.	0
Help me into some house, Benvolio, Or I shall faint.	0
Let me be satisfied.	0
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?	0
Spare not for the cost.	0
Come, death, and welcome!	0
My master is the great rich Capulet, and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush a cup of wine.	0
Where's Romeo?	0
Monday!	0
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.	0
Speakest thou from thy heart?	0
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.	0
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here Shalt with him hence.	0
Stand up.	0
How fares my Juliet?	0
Be ruled by me.	0
What's this?	0
Some comfort, Nurse.	0
Seigneur Martino and his wife and daughters ; County Anselme and his beauteous sisters ; The lady widow of Vitruvio ; Seigneur Placentio and his lovely nieces ; Mercutio and his brother Valentine ; Mine uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters ; My fair niece Rosaline and Livia ;	0
Your love says, like an honest gentleman,'Where is your mother?	0
Dove-feathered raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!	0
A man, young lady!	0
I will go along.	0
Either withdraw unto some private place, And reason coldly of your grievances, Or else depart.	0
She's dead, she's dead, she's dead!	0
I'll play the housewife for this once.	0
Is it my lady mother?	0
Why, love, I say.	0
Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in.	0
Why dost thou stay?	0
Take up those cords., Poor ropes, you are beguiled, Both you and I, for Romeo is exiled.	0
Famine is in thy cheeks.	0
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill the other.	0
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.	0
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora's bed, Away from light steals home my heavy son,	0
Will it not be?	0
What is this?	0
Tis he, that villain Romeo.	0
By my head, here comes the Capulets.	0
Oh, let us hence.	0
I'll to dinner.	0
I would I were thy bird.	0
Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.	0
Tybalt, my cousin!	0
Do not deny to him that you love me.	0
An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.	0
I'll to the friar to know his remedy.	0
Have you importuned him by any means?	0
Answer to that.	0
Here's Romeo's man.	0
I pray thee, chide not.	0
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.	0
What, Nurse, I say!	0
She's not well married that lives married long, But she's best married that dies married young.	0
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.	0
The sweeter rest was mine.	0
Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.	0
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty.	0
I'll look to like if looking liking move.	0
Tis torture and not mercy.	0
There, where the torch doth burn.	0
"Friends, part! "" and, swifter than his tongue, His agile arm beats down their fatal points, And'twixt them rushes, underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled."	0
Come you to make confession to this Father?	0
I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet.	0
All this is comfort.	0
Here's such a coil.	0
A right good markman!	0
You must contrary me.	0
Do not answer me.	0
For what, I pray thee?	0
Your houses!	0
The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night, Checkering the eastern clouds with streaks of light, And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.	0
Oh, he's a lovely gentleman.	0
Eyes, look your last.	0
Tis but thy name that is my enemy.	0
You are too hot.	0
I'll to my rest.	0
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man.	0
By my heel, I care not.	0
I would not for the world they saw thee here.	0
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.	0
I have forgot why I did call thee back.	0
Whither should they come?	0
Go in, and tell my lady I am gone, Having displeased my father, to Lawrence's cell To make confession and to be absolved.	0
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?	0
A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents.	0
Ha, ha.	0
And is he a man to encounter Tybalt?	0
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?	0
I have a head, sir, that will find out logs, And never trouble Peter for the matter.	0
Oh, she is lame!	0
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?	0
Hie to your chamber.	0
I know not, sir.	0
"Say thou but ""ay, "" And that bare vowel Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice."	0
"Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship And needly will be ranked with other griefs, Why followed not, when she said ""Tybalt's dead, "" ""Thy father"" or ""thy mother, "" nay, or both, Which modern lamentations might have moved?"	0
O fortune, fortune!	0
Stay the friar too.	0
I will hence tonight.	0
Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow.	0
Even or odd, of all days in the year, Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.	0
Thou hast amazed me.	0
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw In lasting labor of his pilgrimage.	0
I'll not be forsworn.	0
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.	0
Arise.	0
Hang him, Jack!	0
"How hast thou the heart, Being a divine, a ghostly confessor, A sin-absolver, and my friend professed, To mangle me with that word ""banished""?"	0
Have you got leave to go to shrift today?	0
Cast it off!	0
Very well took, i' faith, wisely, wisely.	0
An thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords.	0
But by and by comes back to Romeo, Who had but newly entertained revenge, And to't they go like lightning, for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain.	0
Is't so, indeed?	0
Not life, but love in death.	0
I pray, sir, can you read?	0
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?	0
Go to, go to.	0
Get me ink and paper, And hire post horses.	0
Trust to't, bethink you.	0
Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail, Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.	0
Come, I'll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.	0
But I pray, can you read anything you see?	0
You know not how to choose a man.	0
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe, A villain that is hither come in spite To scorn at our solemnity this night.	0
Then I'll be brief.	0
So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed.	0
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth, and yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four, she is not fourteen.	0
Farewell, dear Father.	0
And here stands all your state : Either be gone before the watch be set, Or by the break of day disguised from hence.	0
More validity, More honorable state, more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo.	0
They pray ; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.	0
"Thou art like one of those fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and says ""God send me no need of thee! "" and, by the operation of the second cup, draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need."	0
If I do so, it will be of more price Being spoke behind your back than to your face.	0
Thou villain Capulet!	0
But old folks, many feign as they were dead, Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.	0
He made you for a highway to my bed, But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.	0
I will then give it you soundly.	0
Full half an hour.	0
News from Verona!, How now, Balthasar?	0
Younger than you Here in Verona, ladies of esteem Are made already mothers.	0
Who calls so loud?	0
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget, Forgetting any other home but this.	0
Towards him I made, but he was'ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood.	0
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence' cell Be shrived and married.	0
It was the nightingale, and not the lark, That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.	0
Two such opposed kings encamp them still, In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will.	0
Out, you green sickness, carrion!	0
To answer that, I should confess to you.	0
Talk no more.	0
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.	0
I will kiss thy lips.	0
Oh, it is my love.	0
Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.	0
O Lord, I could have stayed here all the night To hear good counsel.	0
"Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud, Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine, With repetition of ""My Romeo! "" It is my soul that calls upon my name."	0
I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man.	0
Oh, where is Romeo?	0
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses.	0
Romeo, come forth.	0
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.	0
Oh, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.	0
And if I can not, I'll find those that shall.	0
Thus then in brief : The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.	0
What, have you dined at home?	0
Hence, be gone, away!	0
O, tell me, Friar, tell me, In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge?	0
Here comes your father.	0
Ye say honestly.	0
Methinks I see my cousin's ghost Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body Upon a rapier's point.	0
You'll be sick tomorrow For this night's watching.	0
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.	0
I must another way To fetch a ladder, by the which your love Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.	0
Holy Franciscan Friar!	0
My wits faints.	0
O me, O me!	0
Oh, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!	0
If all else fail, myself have power to die.	0
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.	0
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, Till we can clear these ambiguities And know their spring, their head, their true descent, And then will I be general of your woes, And lead you even to death.	0
You kiss by th' book.	0
It is the lark that sings so out of tune, Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.	0
It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer, And light thee on thy way to Mantua.	0
It is not yet near day.	0
Call her forth to me.	0
This torture should be roared in dismal hell.	0
Meantime forbear, And let mischance be slave to patience., Bring forth the parties of suspicion.	0
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.	0
Come between us, good Benvolio.	0
May not one speak?	0
Not I, believe me.	0
His son is thirty.	0
I do remember well where I should be, And there I am.	0
Where shall we dine?, O me!	0
I do defy thy commination And apprehend thee for a felon here.	0
Romeo, will you come to your father's?	0
Yea, is the worst well?	0
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.	0
Romeo can, Though heaven can not.	0
O woeful sympathy, Piteous predicament!	0
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play, Alone, in company, still my care hath been To have her matched.	0
Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five.	0
Her vestal livery is but sick and green, And none but fools do wear it.	0
Never was seen so black a day as this.	0
Within the infant rind of this small flower Poison hath residence and medicine power.	0
No money, on my faith, but the gleek.	0
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.	0
Hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks, With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold, Think true love acted simple modesty.	0
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown, But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.	0
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now., My lord, we must entreat the time alone.	0
I beseech you, follow straight.	0
Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?	0
Monday, my lord.	0
Alack the day!	0
Now, fellow, What is there?	0
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves With all the admired beauties of Verona.	0
Death's the end of all.	0
She's not fourteen.	0
Wouldst thou withdraw it?	0
Hie, make haste, Make haste.	0
Amen, amen.	0
Pitiful sight!	0
Therefore, have done.	0
Why, I am glad on't.	0
Get you to bed, faith.	0
Grief of my son's exile hath stopped her breath.	0
The law that threatened death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile, there art thou happy.	0
Not in a grave, To lay one in, another out to have.	0
Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too, He shall not make me there a joyful bride.	0
What, rouse thee, man!	0
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?	0
Go thither, and with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show, And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.	0
But all this did I know before.	0
Take no note of him.	0
The time is very short.	0
Reply not.	0
It is not day.	0
O life!	0
No, my good lord.	0
Good Father, I beseech you on my knees, Hear me with patience but to speak a word.	0
We'll keep no great ado, a friend or two.	0
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time, But I will watch you from such watching now.	0
Let's see for means.	0
An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.	0
Alack the day.	0
Some others search.	0
You'll not endure him!	0
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.	0
"Shake! "" quoth the dovehouse."	0
Is thy news good, or bad?	0
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?	0
Thou need'st not to be gone.	0
What say you?	0
Stay but a little.	0
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all In this so sudden business.	0
No, no.	0
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.	0
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.	0
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.	0
But to be frank, and give it thee again.	0
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse.	0
Tis all one.	0
Oh, look!	0
I will confess to you that I love him.	0
The bridegroom he is come already.	0
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.	0
But come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be, For this alliance may so happy prove To turn your households' rancor to pure love.	0
Thy drugs are quick.	0
Let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels.	0
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid.	0
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.	0
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.	0
Alas the day, it did.	0
Go, sirrah, trudge about Through fair Verona.	0
It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.	0
Not mad, but bound more than a madman is, Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipped and tormented and, Good e'en, good fellow.	0
I like it not.	0
Behind the abbey wall Within this hour my man shall be with thee And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair, Which to the high top-gallant of my joy Must be my convoy in the secret night.	0
But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.	0
Then weep no more.	0
And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling!	0
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.	0
If my heart's dear love, Well, do not swear.	0
I dreamt a dream tonight.	0
Hath Romeo slain himself?	0
For shame, bring Juliet forth.	0
Thou art not conquered.	0
Come, we burn daylight, ho!	0
Why, bride!	0
It is my lady.	0
Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.	0
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.	0
Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid.	0
Nay, as they dare.	0
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady., Lord, Lord!	0
Tell me, daughter Juliet, How stands your disposition to be married?	0
Wherefore weep I then?	0
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, To merit bliss by making me despair.	0
Then have at thee, boy!	0
God ye good e'en, fair gentlewoman.	0
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age.	0
Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old I bade her come.	0
O, what more favor can I do to thee, Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy?	0
And we mean well in going to this mask, But'tis no wit to go.	0
Honest Nurse, farewell.	0
And yet I wish but for the thing I have.	0
What, drawn, and talk of peace?	0
Stand not amazed.	0
Stay not, be gone.	0
Good night.	0
Do you like this haste?	0
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.	0
A challenge, on my life.	0
"For himself to mar, "" quoth he?"	0
What is your will?	0
Marry,'tis enough.	0
Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.	0
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.	0
She will indite him to some supper.	0
Romeo!	0
My sword, I say!	0
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes.	0
Yes, madam.	0
It is an honor that I dream not of.	0
"Seigneur Valentio and his cousin Tybalt ; Lucio and the lively Helena."" A fair assembly."	0
I will show myself a tyrant.	0
Without his roe, like a dried herring.	0
An eagle, madam, Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye As Paris hath.	0
Lay hand on heart, advise.	0
That dreamers often lie.	0
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.	0
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.	0
I am not here.	0
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!	0
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.	0
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill. Move them no more by crossing their high will.	0
Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death, As that the villain lives which slaughtered him.	0
A lantern, slaughtered youth, For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light.	0
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.	0
Hence, and stand aloof.	0
Come, what says Romeo?	0
Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.	0
Perchance she can not meet him.	0
Romeo.	0
Need you my help?	0
But come what sorrow can, It can not countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight.	0
Tis late.	0
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.	0
Romeo slew Tybalt.	0
Courage, man.	0
What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?	0
Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin?	0
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.	0
I will die, And leave him all.	0
An he speak any thing against me, I'll take him down, an he were lustier than he is, and twenty such Jacks.	0
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows, Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.	0
Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.	0
Now heaven hath all,	0
Then I will give you the serving creature.	0
Feeling so the loss, Can not choose but ever weep the friend.	0
Stand, an you be a man.	0
Men's eyes were made to look and let them gaze.	0
Why, lady!	0
No matter.	0
They have made worms' meat of me.	0
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.	0
Come hither, man.	0
I do bite my thumb, sir.	0
This is the place.	0
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!	0
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.	0
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.	0
I hear some noise within.	0
Hie you to church.	0
Come, come with me, and we will make short work.	0
Dear love, adieu., Anon, good Nurse!, Sweet Montague, be true.	0
You take your pennyworths now.	0
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.	0
Do you quarrel, sir?	0
Juliet!, Fast, I warrant her, she., Why, lamb!	0
Oh, God'i' good e'en.	0
That's a certain text.	0
Commend me to thy lady, And bid her hasten all the house to bed, Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.	0
And where the worser is predominant, Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.	0
Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat to scratch a man to death!	0
Henceforward do your messages yourself.	0
On, lusty gentlemen.	0
Wife!	0
Now must I to the monument alone.	0
"Do not say ""banishment."" Hence from Verona art thou banished."	0
Go, be gone.	0
Wilt thou provoke me?	0
Faith, I know not what to say.	0
Wednesday is tomorrow.	0
Is Romeo slaughtered, and is Tybalt dead?	0
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.	0
When and where and how We met, we wooed and made exchange of vow, I'll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray : That thou consent to marry us today.	0
Strike!	0
What, dost thou make us minstrels?	0
I have watched ere now All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.	0
Love give me strength, and strength shall help afford.	0
Old Montague is come, And flourishes his blade in spite of me.	0
Peter!	0
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff.	0
Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress.	0
Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon.	0
My words would bandy her to my sweet love, And his to me.	0
Hie you to the cell.	0
I'll make you quiet., What, cheerly, my hearts!	0
Chopped logic!	0
Therefore he that can not lick his fingers goes not with me.	0
Came he not home tonight?	0
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead!	0
What, still in tears, Evermore showering?	0
Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?	0
How shall that faith return again to earth, Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth?	0
Was that my father that went hence so fast?	0
But let them measure us by what they will.	0
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child, But one thing to rejoice and solace in, And cruel death hath catched it from my sight!	0
We found him in the churchyard.	0
You lie.	0
Is it good e'en?	0
Farewell!, God knows when we shall meet again.	0
O woeful, woeful, woeful day!	0
Not to his father's.	0
The other did not so.	0
I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.	0
Art thou a man?	0
And how doth she?	0
The hurt can not be much.	0
"I know thou wilt say ""ay, "" And I will take thy word."	0
Welcome from Mantua.	0
Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers.	0
Pronounce this sentence then : Women may fall when there's no strength in men.	0
Were you by when it began?	0
Good heart, at what?	0
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me occasion.	0
Happily met, my lady and my wife.	0
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.	0
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses, Therefore use none.	0
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep, My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.	0
To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.	0
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.	0
What's your will?	0
Quarrel, sir?	0
Ah, welladay!	0
We waste our lights in vain, like lights by day.	0
Is he gone and hath nothing?	0
Give me a torch.	0
O heavy day!	0
O God, did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?	0
Romeo, away, be gone!	0
Come, vial.	0
Go.	0
Romeo is coming.	0
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?	0
Is the day so young?	0
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.	0
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed.	0
Romeo must not live.	0
Why should you fall into so deep an O?	0
There stays a husband to make you a wife.	0
What of that?	0
I have an interest in your hearts' proceeding.	0
Tush, thou art deceived.	0
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy Be heaped like mine, and that thy skill be more To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath This neighbor air, and let rich music's tongue Unfold the imagined happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter.	0
What, are you mad?	0
Ah me!	0
And badest me bury love.	0
Am I come near ye now?, Welcome, gentlemen!	0
Ah sir, ah sir.	0
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.	0
Thursday is near.	0
O mischief, thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!	0
O lamentable day!	0
Sin from thy lips?	0
Here comes my man.	0
Put up thy sword, Or manage it to part these men with me.	0
Whose house?	0
Or if not so, then here I hit it right : Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.	0
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.	0
There is time enough.	0
Ready to go, but never to return.	0
There lies that Tybalt.	0
What?	0
My lord and you were then at Mantua., Nay, I do bear a brain., But, as I said, When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!	0
Now do you know the reason of this haste.	0
You are a saucy boy.	0
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!	0
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied, And vice sometime by action dignified.	0
Indeed, I should have asked thee that before.	0
Romeo's a dishclout to him.	0
Go thy ways, wench.	0
He bears him like a portly gentleman, And, to say truth, Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-governed youth.	0
Commend me to your daughter.	0
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law.	0
My life were better ended by their hate Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.	0
I am none of his flirt-gills.	0
But I will write again to Mantua, And keep her at my cell till Romeo come.	0
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye, And where care lodges, sleep will never lie.	0
Is your man secret?	0
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end., O churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop To help me after?	0
Father, what news?	0
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards., Is it e'en so?	0
Ay, boy, ready.	0
There is no world without Verona walls But purgatory, torture, hell itself.	0
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly.	0
Adieu, adieu!	0
Tell me, good my friend, What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls?	0
Tell him so yourself, And see how he will take it at your hands.	0
It is, it is.	0
Come, stir, stir, stir!	0
"Romeo is banished."" There is no end, no limit, measure, bound, In that word's death."	0
What's he that now is going out of door?	0
Amen!	0
I would the fool were married to her grave!	0
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.	0
Doth not Ay, Nurse, what of that?	0
Buy food, and get thyself in flesh., Come, cordial and not poison, go with me To Juliet's grave, for there must I use thee.	0
Forget to think of her.	0
Unhappy fortune!	0
Good night, good night!	0
What villain, madam?	0
These are news indeed!	0
The curfew bell hath rung.	0
Mass, and well said.	0
Hold, then.	0
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit Of an old tear that is not washed off yet.	0
O woe!	0
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn, The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.	0
Romeo!, Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains The stony entrance of the sepulcher?	0
Commend me to thy lady.	0
Tis no time to play now.	0
Can you not conceive?	0
Farewell.	0
O deadly sin!	0
Tell me, that I may sack The hateful mansion.	0
Why, uncle,'tis a shame.	0
Comfort me.	0
O' Thursday be it, then., Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed.	0
I protest unto thee, Good heart, and i' faith, I will tell her as much.	0
With another, for tying his new shoes with old ribbon?	0
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris.	0
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh!	0
I will give you the minstrel.	0
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.	0
Can you not stay awhile?	0
Tybalt would kill thee, But thou slew'st Tybalt, there art thou happy.	0
O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!	0
It is a most sharp sauce.	0
Most detestable Death, by thee beguiled, By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown!	0
The fearful passage of their death-marked love And the continuance of their parents' rage, Which, but their children's end, naught could remove, Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage, The which, if you with patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.	0
I will not fail.	0
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?	0
Therefore turn and draw.	0
Here were the servants of your adversary, And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.	0
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench, Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.	0
The cords That Romeo bid thee fetch?	0
Why, how now, Juliet?	0
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years.	0
"Hence ""banished"" is banished from the world, And world's exile is death."	0
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child.	0
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.	0
Of love?	0
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slandered it.	0
But, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world.	0
This is she, Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!	0
Madam!	0
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting.	0
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.	0
Give me thy hand.	0
And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find, Many for many virtues excellent, None but for some and yet all different.	0
Here's drink.	0
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.	0
What, lamb!	0
Their course of love, the tidings of her death.	0
But saying o'er what I have said before.	0
"But with a rearward following Tybalt's death, ""Romeo is banished."" To speak that word, Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, All slain, all dead."	0
You say you do not know the lady's mind.	0
Not having that which, having, makes them short.	0
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.	0
Hast thou not a word of joy?	0
Peace, ho, for shame!	0
Here all eyes gaze on us.	0
O comfortable Friar!	0
Ha, banishment!	0
How, will she none?	0
Death is my heir.	0
Content thee, gentle coz.	0
Beat them down!	0
Down with the Capulets!	0
Who is't that calls?	0
Is love a tender thing?	0
Madam, if you could find out but a man To bear a poison, I would temper it, That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, Soon sleep in quiet.	0
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.	0
Out, you baggage!	0
Arms, take your last embrace.	0
"Wilt thou not, Jule? "" It stinted and said ""ay."" And stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I."	0
Let them begin.	0
Madam.	0
He is wise, And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.	0
Out on her, hilding!	0
Sole monarch of the universal earth, Oh, what a beast was I to chide at him!	0
Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies.	0
O, be gone!	0
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?	0
That's not so.	0
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do.	0
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.	0
A plague o' both your houses!	0
Cheerly, boys.	0
Oh, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?	0
Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans, Mistlike, infold me from the search of eyes.	0
Strike, drum.	0
I beseech thee, youth, Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury.	0
Could you not take some occasion without giving?	0
You tallow face!	0
She that makes dainty, She, I'll swear, hath corns.	0
I'll go alone.	0
Where is my page?, Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.	0
Go hence.	0
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly, And so did I.	0
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart.	0
Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.	0
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.	0
O Romeo, Romeo!	0
Do not swear at all.	0
Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.	0
Be fickle, fortune, For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long, But send him back.	0
Oh, thou wilt speak again of banishment.	0
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand.	0
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished.	0
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give.	0
Her eye discourses.	0
What is yond gentleman?	0
How now?	0
But what say you to Thursday?	0
And art thou changed?	0
Tush, I will stir about, And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.	0
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?	0
My soul, and not my child!	0
Hold, there is forty ducats.	0
How canst thou try them so?	0
Her body sleeps in Capels' monument, And her immortal part with angels lives.	0
No, not till Thursday.	0
We'll to dinner, thither.	0
I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I can not move.	0
A merry whoreson, ha!	0
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?	0
With Rosaline, my ghostly Father?	0
Thou know'st my lodging.	0
That's my good son.	0
Call, good Mercutio.	0
I will say for you.	0
For what purpose, love?	0
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.	0
God shield I should disturb devotion!, Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.	0
Thou hast quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun.	0
Or shall we on without apology?	0
How, how, how, how?	0
I speak no treason.	0
Come, Romeo.	0
My lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.	0
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine, And all combined, save what thou must combine By holy marriage.	0
Open the tomb.	0
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit, For'tis a throne where honor may be crowned.	0
If love be rough with you, be rough with love.	0
As I remember, this should be the house.	0
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.	0
Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?	0
Let me see her.	0
What are they, beseech your ladyship?	0
Many a morning hath he there been seen, With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew, Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.	0
Nay, good goose, bite not.	0
Well, we were born to die.	0
I wot well where he is.	0
God's bread!	0
Any man that can write may answer a letter.	0
He was not born to shame.	0
Not a dump, we.	0
I'll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.	0
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?	0
Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.	0
Then, window, let day in and let life out.	0
And what says My concealed lady to our canceled love?	0
Romeo will answer it.	0
Look, look.	0
Get thee gone, And hire those horses.	0
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.	0
Shall I believe That unsubstantial death is amorous, And that the lean abhorred monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour?	0
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.	0
Oh, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad!	0
Stay, fellow.	0
What, mistress!	0
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change, Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse, And all things change them to the contrary.	0
O God!, O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?	0
The boy gives warning something doth approach.	0
They must take it in sense that feel it.	0
What shall I swear by?	0
Who is it?	0
I am not for this ambling.	0
What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?	0
Oh, thou art deceived.	0
"I stretch it out for that word ""broad, "" which, added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose."	0
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.	0
I would have made it short, for I was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.	0
Oh, she knew well Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.	0
Live, and hereafter say A madman's mercy bid thee run away.	0
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?	0
Sojourn in Mantua.	0
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.	0
Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane, and, as thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell., Antony and Potpan!	0
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve Is three long hours, yet she is not come.	0
What said my man, when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode?	0
"Be merciful, say ""death, "" For exile hath more terror in his look, Much more than death."	0
Peace, you mumbling fool!	0
That same villain, Romeo.	0
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me.	0
One, gentlewoman, that God hath made, himself to mar.	0
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, Having some business, do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return.	0
What says he of our marriage?	0
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?	0
You are a lover.	0
Although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract tonight.	0
And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out, And makes himself an artificial night.	0
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste, For beauty, starved with her severity, Cuts beauty off from all posterity.	0
Shame come to Romeo!	0
Romeo!	0
And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.	0
Go and trim her up.	0
I do but keep the peace.	0
Scurvy knave!	0
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?	0
In love?	0
We are undone, lady, we are undone!	0
Take it in what sense thou wilt.	0
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo, My intercession likewise steads my foe.	0
What, ho!	0
Dry sorrow drinks our blood.	0
Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.	0
Now art thou sociable.	0
This wind you talk of, blows us from ourselves.	0
Some say the lark makes sweet division.	0
Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone., O Romeo, that she were!	0
Here's goodly gear.	0
Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged.	0
O woeful day, O woeful day!	0
But I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ.	0
I stand on sudden haste.	0
Why Romeo, art thou mad?	0
Why, what is Tybalt?	0
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault And presently took post to tell it you.	0
He'll fright you up, i' faith.	0
A grave?	0
Tis now near night.	0
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.	0
Farewell!	0
She's dead, deceased, she's dead.	0
What says Romeo?	0
Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?	0
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them, To make me die with a restorative.	0
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.	0
What a pestilent knave is this same!	0
This can not anger him.	0
Out, alas!	0
Send for the county.	0
He speaks not true.	0
And she's fair I love.	0
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.	0
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.	0
His son is elder, sir.	0
Farewell, farewell.	0
Make it a word and a blow.	0
I'll go and chat with Paris.	0
I am aweary.	0
Run to the Capulets.	0
Delay this marriage for a month, a week.	0
The world affords no law to make thee rich.	0
Apothecary!	0
Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.	0
I see that thou art poor.	0
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, Came more and more and fought on part and part, Till the Prince came, who parted either part.	0
My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep.	0
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge, Myself condemned and myself excused.	0
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied.	0
"Hadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground knife, No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean, But ""banished"" to kill me?, ""Banished""!"	0
As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast.	0
Well, what was yours?	0
I must hence to wait.	0
What, shall I groan and tell thee?	0
The fee simple?	0
We follow thee., Juliet, the county stays.	0
What further woe conspires against mine age?	0
Speak, nephew.	0
No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest.	0
In bed asleep while they do dream things true.	0
Ha?	0
I see thou know'st me not.	0
Therefore stay yet.	0
Ay, if I know the letters and the language.	0
Muffle me, night, awhile.	0
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.	0
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose, And then dreams he of smelling out a suit.	0
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.	0
Good morrow, cousin.	0
Your part in her you could not keep from death, But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.	0
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.	0
O love!	0
Perhaps you have learned it without book.	0
Oh, then I see that madmen have no ears.	0
There rust and let me die.	0
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath?	0
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again, Alike bewitched by the charm of looks, But to his foe supposed he must complain, And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.	0
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.	0
I have more care to stay than will to go.	0
Had she affections and warm youthful blood, She would be as swift in motion as a ball.	0
Here is a friar that trembles, sighs and weeps.	0
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.	0
Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.	0
No, coz, I rather weep.	0
Fear me not.	0
O God, she comes., O honey Nurse, what news?	0
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.	0
Look thou but sweet, And I am proof against their enmity.	0
I'll find Romeo To comfort you.	0
Go, you cot-quean, go.	0
Vile earth, to earth resign.	0
Bear hence this body and attend our will.	0
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend Which you weep for.	0
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.	0
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands, and they unwashed too,'tis a foul thing.	0
Out.	0
Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling.	0
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.	0
No, not he, though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's, and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare.	0
O me!	0
What counterfeit did I give you?	0
To wreak the love I bore my cousin Upon his body that slaughtered him!	0
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.	0
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends, And there an end.	0
What o'clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee?	0
By the hour of nine.	0
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend.	0
No words can that woe sound.	0
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?	0
Good even to my ghostly confessor.	0
Give me, give me!	0
Why the devil came you between us?	0
O simple!	0
I dare draw as soon as another man if I see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side.	0
Our whole city is much bound to him.	0
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.	0
We talk here in the public haunt of men.	0
The heads of the maids?	0
Mistress!	0
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am.	0
What, are you busy, ho?	0
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties, or, if love be blind, It best agrees with night.	0
Oh, by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo.	0
Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.	0
Wash they his wounds with tears?	0
O my brother's child!	0
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.	0
But sadly, tell me who.	0
Ascend her chamber, hence, and comfort her.	0
What, art thou hurt?	0
How oft tonight Have my old feet stumbled at graves!, Who's there?	0
Go, then, for'tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found.	0
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.	0
A conduit, girl?	0
Our instruments to melancholy bells, Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast.	0
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.	0
Alas, poor Romeo!	0
Bliss be upon you!	0
Fie, fie!	0
Then will I lay the serving creature's dagger on your pate.	0
Or if it did not, Your first is dead, or'twere as good he were, As living here and you no use of him.	0
Ay, a thousand times., Peter!	0
I do beseech you, sir, have patience.	0
O woeful time.	0
O holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar, Where is my lady's lord?	0
"That ""may be"" must be, love, on Thursday next."	0
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.	0
So ho!	0
Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit, Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.	0
Now art thou Romeo.	0
when'twas a little prating thing., Oh, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard, but she, good soul, had as lief see a toad, a very toad, as see him.	0
That I ask again, For nothing can be ill if she be well.	0
Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.	0
No better.	0
And joy comes well in such a needy time.	0
Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.	0
We'll to church tomorrow.	0
Can I go forward when my heart is here?	0
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.	0
Welcome, gentlemen!	0
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?	0
O Lord, they fight!	0
But, as I said, On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.	0
I will carry no crotchets.	0
"Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished."""	0
Will you tell me that?	0
Said he not so?	0
The all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.	0
More light and light, more dark and dark our woes!	0
Methinks I see thee now, thou art so low As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.	0
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.	0
You know not what you do.	0
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?	0
Speak not.	0
That villain cousin would have killed my husband.	0
Thus with a kiss I die.	0
"Calling death ""banishment, "" Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden ax And smilest upon the stroke that murders me."	0
The slip, sir, the slip.	0
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks.	0
A dog of that house shall move me to stand.	0
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.	0
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.	0
The son and heir of old Tiberio.	0
This same should be the voice of Friar John.	0
Anon!	0
Good morrow to you both.	0
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam, I will not marry yet.	0
Nurse!	0
Therefore love moderately.	0
Look, and thou shalt see.	0
And yet no further than a wanton's bird, That lets it hop a little from his hand Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, And with a silken thread plucks it back again, So loving-jealous of his liberty.	0
I wonder at this haste, that I must wed Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.	0
Come, thou day in night, For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.	0
Fly hence and leave me.	0
The what?	0
"Cry but ""Ay me! "" Pronounce but ""love"" and ""dove."" Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word, One nickname for her purblind son and heir, Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so true When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid., He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not."	0
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.	0
Confusion's cure lives not In these confusions.	0
I will go call the watch.	0
I will, and know her mind early tomorrow.	0
No, sir.	1
Have you seen him today?	1
Indeed, I remember it well.	1
Find the people whose names are on this list?	1
I hear that you must marry this count on Thursday, and that nothing can delay it.	1
Yes, she will.	1
That light is not daylight, I know it.	1
He's hiding out in Friar Lawrence's cell.	1
May a plague strike both your families!	1
If they see you, they'll murder you.	1
Let's talk.	1
Have a nice day!	1
Go ask.	1
I hope you're lucky enough to hear the true story by sticking around.	1
It's been eleven years since the earthquake.	1
Yes, that's true.	1
You have the best sorts of happiness to enjoy.	1
Oh, then I see you've been with Who's Queen Mab?	1
Who's ruining my rituals of true love?	1
Ask for me tomorrow, and you'll find me in a grave.	1
I'm not one of his punk friends who carries a knife.	1
Goodbye, cousin.	1
Curse my very heart, but I think you should be happy in this second marriage, because it's better than your first.	1
Well, Susan died and is with God.	1
Flies are like free men, but I have been banished.	1
Let me tell you, the man who marries her will become very wealthy.	1
If you were ever yourself, and this sadness was yours, you and your sadness were all for Rosaline.	1
Are you going?	1
Then I rebel against you, stars!	1
Have you given up so quickly on Rosaline, whom you loved so much?	1
I'll come back.	1
Who's calling me?	1
Come, come away.	1
Oh, are you going to leave me so unsatisfied?	1
Madam, I am not well.	1
Here, here I'll remain with worms that are your chamber-maids.	1
Yes, let the count take you in your bed.	1
Please be quiet.	1
It's a good thing you're not a piece of fish.	1
My master's house.	1
Stay, then.	1
His crime did justice's job by taking Tybalt's life.	1
Wait, Tybalt, wait!	1
She's shut inside a dead man's tomb!	1
"It is ""music with her silver sound, "" because musicians have no gold to use to make sounds."	1
The Right.	1
A jealous woman, a jealous woman!	1
You're wearing dancing shoes with nimble soles.	1
I hate the word peace like I hate hell, all Montagues, and you.	1
Who are you?	1
I'm not going to bed tonight.	1
It's out of fashion to give lengthy explanations like that.	1
If you who are so wise can't help, please be kind enough to call my solution wise.	1
Oh, noise?	1
He's not your man.	1
You'll fight with a man who's cracking nuts just because you have hazelnut-colored eyes.	1
Leave him alone.	1
This calm submission is dishonorable and vile.	1
His face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun.	1
Why did this have to happen now?	1
I wish that no one could avenge my cousin's death except me!	1
I'll go to him.	1
Why are you knocking so hard?	1
What have you found out?	1
Oh Friar, damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell.	1
Are you going to join them?	1
How sweet it would be to actually have the woman I love, when merely thinking about love makes me so happy.	1
Their unfortunate deaths put an end to their parents' feud.	1
What kind of man are you?	1
Look, sir, here comes the lady walking toward my cell.	1
She's not talking to me.	1
I met the young man at Lawrence's cell.	1
Oh, a footstep as light as hers will never endure the rocky road of life.	1
Listen, because Tybalt was just killed, people might think that we don't care about his memory as our relative if we have too grand a party.	1
That knife should be in its sheath on that Montague's back, but instead it's mis-sheathed in my daughter's breast.	1
I won't miss any chance to send my love to you.	1
I do.	1
What an awful day!	1
Answer me like men.	1
Yes, this is what love does.	1
His son was a minor only two years ago.	1
Think about the ones who have died.	1
It was.	1
I hope sores cover your tongue for a wish like that!	1
Mercutio, you hang out with Romeo.	1
You were never with me for anything if you weren't there for the goose.	1
Girls younger than she often marry and become happy mothers.	1
I am content, if that's the way you want it.	1
Brother, hey!	1
How should madmen hear, if wise men can't even see?	1
"But I can't help laughing to think that the baby stopped crying and said, ""Yes."" I swear, she had a bump on her forehead as big as a rooster's testicle."	1
It is written that shoemakers and tailors should play with each others' tools, that fisherman should play with paints, and painters should play with with fishing nets.	1
The second cock crowed.	1
I hit hard when I'm angry.	1
Come on, you can be as angry as any guy in Italy when you're in the mood.	1
Sing my praises to your mistress.	1
Tomorrow night make sure that you are alone.	1
That rotten scoundrel!	1
My sweet, so do I.	1
My child, my reason for living, wake up, look up, or I'll die with you!	1
So calm down.	1
Tybalt, I have a reason to love you that lets me put aside the rage I should feel and excuse that insult.	1
Leave me alone.	1
Where else would she be?	1
He's not the most polite man in the world, but, believe me, he's gentle as a lamb.	1
I thought it was the right thing to do.	1
What will we say is our excuse for being here?	1
Romeo?	1
Wake up the Montagues.	1
Well, may peace be with you.	1
The strangers are all gone.	1
Very suspicious.	1
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo!	1
That braggart, punk villain who fights like he learned swordsmanship from a manual!	1
Your husband lies dead there, and Paris too.	1
You won't, then?	1
Tell her about my son Paris's love for her.	1
Was I even close to you in the chase for the goose?	1
The ground is bloody.	1
She's talking, but she's not saying anything.	1
A woman more beautiful than the one I love?	1
Take these keys and get more spices, Nurse.	1
I assure you, my man is as true as steel.	1
How is she?	1
And so, good Capulet, which is a name I love like my own name, you should be satisfied with what I say.	1
Am I really like one of those guys?	1
He's alive and victorious, and Mercutio's dead?	1
Keep going, keep going, or I'll declare myself the winner.	1
Angry enough to run away.	1
Another studpid answer!	1
Leaving you is a thousand times worse than being near you.	1
Oh, good, a knife!	1
If you sink, you're dragging love down.	1
The things I'm saying are fair and honest.	1
Yes, I know her age down to the hour.	1
The Earth is nature's mother and also nature's tomb.	1
Believe me, I'm sorry you're in pain.	1
What is the matter?	1
What kind of devil are you to torture me like this?	1
Find out the way, and I'll find the right man.	1
Use your clubs and spears!	1
What strange reason could she have for coming here?	1
Now I'll go see my priest, to ask for his help and tell him about my good luck.	1
Where is she?	1
I drink to you.	1
You would fight with a man if he had one more whisker or one less whisker in his beard than you have in your beard.	1
Now, good sweet Nurse, Oh Lord, why do you look so sad?	1
I asked a servant.	1
Is it really true?	1
I didn't see anybody use you for kicks.	1
Can God be so jealous and hateful?	1
I don't dare, sir.	1
Be good.	1
You're not paying attention to me.	1
Everyone prepare to take this beautiful corpse to her grave.	1
Oh, he's like a snake disguised as a flower.	1
I'll bite my thumb at them.	1
So did I.	1
Hurry up, I say.	1
I'll punish you so harshly that you'll regret causing me this loss.	1
Leave me and do what I told you to do.	1
Are you this impatient?	1
I swear, it must be thirty years.	1
It makes me mad.	1
It looks to me like it's burning in the Capulet tomb.	1
Now I'll tell you so you don't have to ask.	1
Farewell.	1
So, goodbye.	1
What's this?	1
What if this mixture doesn't work at all?	1
No.	1
She's lying on the ground just like him, blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.	1
Why are you acting so angry?	1
This is good.	1
Oh, noble prince, I can tell you everything about the unfortunate circumstances of this deadly fight.	1
Have you spoken to him?	1
Oh, blessed, blessed night!	1
You look pale and wild as if you're going to hurt yourself.	1
She was too good for me.	1
You know how young my daughter is.	1
Well then.	1
The Prince will give you the death penalty if you get caught.	1
My soul depends on it, A thousand times good night.	1
Girls who marry so young grow up too soon.	1
Death is my son-in-law.	1
Come out, you frightened man.	1
Day has broken.	1
Where are my father and my mother, Nurse?	1
Go wisely and slowly.	1
Don't tell me that you've heard about this marriage, Friar, unless you can tell me how to prevent it.	1
I swear by my holy order, I thought you were smarter and more rational than this.	1
My daughter is still very young.	1
Saint Francis, help me!	1
From now until then seems like twenty years.	1
Leave me alone for a minute.	1
She's calling out my name as if I were a bullet murdering her, just like I murdered her relative.	1
What's all the noise in here?	1
Isn't she proud of such a match?	1
What will you give us?	1
Groan?	1
Give me those flowers.	1
And what about that?	1
"Romeo cried out, ""Stop, my friends."	1
What's this noise?	1
I'm finished.	1
As I slept under this yew-tree here, I had a dream that my master and someone else were fighting and that my master killed him.	1
You are dead!	1
I don't know his name.	1
If you were as young as I am, if you were in love with Juliet, if you had just married her an hour ago, if then you murdered Tybalt, if you were lovesick like me, and if you were banished, then you might talk about it.	1
Educated men are so impressive!	1
Give me the letter.	1
Where the devil can Romeo be?	1
If any of my relatives find you here they'll kill you because of who you are.	1
No, Romeo will respond to the letter's writer, telling him whether he accepts the challenge.	1
Well, start thinking about marriage now.	1
My baby hawk?	1
Take away the stools, the sideboards, and the plates.	1
Therefore, the fact that you're awake this early tells me you've been upset with some anxiety.	1
You speak well.	1
It's only just now nine o'clock.	1
Give me your torch, boy.	1
I'm suddenly afraid.	1
Yes, those are the best clothes.	1
Oh nature, what were you doing in hell?	1
Things have turned out so unluckily, sir, that we haven't had time to convince our daughter to marry you.	1
The sound of lovers calling each others names through the night is silver-sweet.	1
Let them put fear in your heart.	1
I'll bring you there.	1
Holy Father Lawrence instructed me to fall on my knees and beg your forgiveness.	1
Come on, you're being ridiculous!	1
What do you have to say, my dear Nurse?	1
On Thursday, sir?	1
Hide yourself, good Romeo.	1
The citizens are around, and Tybalt is dead.	1
Or was I dreaming?	1
But here come some people, right in the nick of time.	1
It did, it did.	1
Where is my mother?	1
But where have you been?	1
I wish I had not lived long enough to see him die.	1
Tonight I'm having a feast that we've celebrated for many years.	1
Madam, your mother wants to talk to you.	1
Have I waited so long to see this morning, only to see this?	1
Will you cry about your cousin's death forever?	1
That's because the murderer is alive.	1
I'll go, sir, and I won't bother you.	1
I drew my sword to part them.	1
Sir Paris, I'll make a desperate argument for my child's love.	1
Oh, in this love, you love your child so badly, that you go mad, even though she is in heaven.	1
It was a painful bruise, and she was crying bitterly.	1
I'll tell you before you have to ask me again.	1
Tomorrow I'll send the messenger.	1
Where is my husband?	1
In the meantime I wrote to Romeo and told him to come here on this awful night to help remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off.	1
Love's messengers should be thoughts, which fly ten times faster than sunbeams.	1
This fight will decide who dies.	1
I am no villain.	1
Life, wealth, everything belongs to Death.	1
Alright, I will.	1
I am the greatest, but I was able to do the least.	1
Hey, are you biting your thumb at us?	1
This sight of death is like a bell that warns me I'm old and I'll die soon.	1
She's been dead for some time.	1
I'll fight you.	1
Benvolio is part of the Montague family.	1
"Oh, "" he said, ""Did you fall on your face?"	1
If love is blind, it can't hit the target.	1
You won't get any bad cooks from me.	1
That is the key to long-lasting love.	1
Oh, Juliet, I already know about your sad situation.	1
Do you hear me?	1
Is my father well?	1
She's dead, like a beautiful flower, killed by an unseasonable frost.	1
Wait good Nurse.	1
A little bit of grief shows a lot of love.	1
And yet you say that exile is not death?	1
That's the way to show me friendship.	1
Oh, I'll rest here forever.	1
That banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts.	1
I have my naked sword out.	1
Noble Mercutio, put your sword away.	1
I know all of this.	1
Then isn't it just the right dish for a sweet goose?	1
Yet I wish I could take that promise back, so I had it to give again.	1
And Juliet's just as much in love as he, but she has even less opportunity to meet her lover.	1
Were you talking about Juliet?	1
God bless you.	1
To our house.	1
Yes, yes, this is the rope ladder.	1
There were twenty Montagues fighting in this awful riot, and together those twenty could only kill one man.	1
Where?	1
If her eyes were in the night sky, they would shine so brightly through space that birds would start singing, thinking her light was the light of day.	1
Yes, alright, go, I say, and bring him here.	1
Are you gone like that, my love, my lord?	1
What?	1
Oh, I wish I was the glove on that hand so that I could touch that cheek.	1
Come over here, nurse.	1
I'll send a man to Mantua, where that exiled rogue is living.	1
So what?	1
"Some people in the street are crying ""Romeo."" Some are crying ""Juliet, "" and some are crying ""Paris."" They're all running in an open riot toward our tomb."	1
Let me stand here until you remember your reason.	1
They howl about banishment.	1
Tybalt, that murderer, which way did he run?	1
Where do you come from?	1
Oh, he's acting just like Juliet, just like her.	1
Wait.	1
I would be glad to forget about it, but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds.	1
It's a cup, closed in my true love's hand?	1
What's the problem, that they cry out so loud?	1
Have you told her our decision?	1
"They both begin with the letter ""R."" Ah, you jokester, that's the dog's name."	1
It's not true because she separates us.	1
I had put bitter wormwood on my breast as I was sitting in the sun, under the wall of the dovehouse.	1
I don't know, and he won't tell me.	1
I'm a friend, a friend who knows you well.	1
We took this pickax and this shovel from him, as he was walking from this side of the graveyard.	1
Go.	1
I'm not myself.	1
Where is my Romeo?	1
What?	1
I wish I were Sleep and Peace, so I could spend the night with you.	1
Oh, pardon me for bringing this bad news, but you told me it was my job, sir.	1
Hurry up, or I'll smack you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn.	1
And tell her, listen to me, on Wednesday, Wait, What day is today?	1
I wouldn't insult him in my own house for all the wealth in this town.	1
She's cold.	1
Do so, and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me.	1
I'll find your servant, and he'll update you now and then on your case as it stands here.	1
They are crying and moaning over Tybalt's corpse.	1
Don't you have a letter for me from the friar?	1
If I had seen something like that, I would have quickly pulled out my weapon.	1
The excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself.	1
Let's go at it, coward!	1
Teach me to forget to think!	1
Today's a holiday, so the beggar's shop is shut.	1
Then hurry up and rush over to Friar Lawrence's cell.	1
Have you killed Tybalt?	1
I wish you had my bones, and I had your news.	1
Down with the Montagues!	1
But love gives them power, and time gives them the chance to meet, sweetening the extreme danger with intense pleasure.	1
God in heaven bless her!	1
"If he's been killed, say ""Yes."" If not, say ""No."" These short words will determine my joy or my pain."	1
Why, she's inside.	1
He ran this way and jumped over this orchard wall.	1
Goodbye.	1
Oh, brother Montague, give me your hand.	1
Hurry up, hurry up.	1
Is it good or bad?	1
Who should now pay the price for Mercutio's life?	1
You're Pull out your tool now.	1
Everybody knows I'm a nice piece of flesh.	1
Peter, wait for me at the gate.	1
Let me be put to death.	1
Because it's dark out, I'm afraid all this is just a dream, too sweet to be real.	1
Despised, distressed, hated, martyred, killed!	1
I'll follow after you.	1
Tybalt was my dearest cousin.	1
Go blabber with your gossiping friends.	1
And why, wise lady?	1
No gentlemen, don't get ready to go now.	1
Nurse, where's my daughter?	1
The groans you used to make are still ringing in my old ears.	1
His arrow has pierced me too deeply, so I can't fly high with his cheerful feathers.	1
Didn't you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season?	1
Sometimes she tickles a priest's nose with a Enough, enough!	1
Do you love me?	1
Sweetheart!	1
I've been hurt.	1
Madam, I'm here.	1
Take Cupid's wings and fly higher than the average man.	1
What crimes happen so early in the morning that I have to wake up before the usual time?	1
Lie down right there.	1
Even if the news is sad, tell me with a smile on your face.	1
Those who rush stumble and fall.	1
Somebody's knocking.	1
What must be will be.	1
Give me one kiss, and I'll go down.	1
Your mother.	1
I hear some noise.	1
I'm done for.	1
Send your man away.	1
Two unlucky children of these enemy families become lovers and commit suicide.	1
"You wouldn't tell a sick man he ""seriously"" has to make his will, it would just make him worse."	1
Take this.	1
Tybalt's death would be bad enough if that was all.	1
Her bridegroom is here.	1
Lady, come out of the tomb.	1
Oh, rude and unthankful boy!	1
Up.	1
Well, Juliet, I'll lie with you tonight.	1
Yes, madam, he lies beyond my reach.	1
And aren't you a Montague?	1
I can imagine more than I can say, I have more on my mind than words.	1
I will be brief because I'm not going to live long enough to tell a boring story.	1
May a plague strike both your houses.	1
It's someone with a torch!	1
My employer is as good as yours.	1
I'm whipped and tortured, May God give you a good evening.	1
She and Susan, God rest her and all Christian souls, were born on the same day.	1
There was no need to tell me to get out of there.	1
Let's get away, Tybalt.	1
Don't you see that I'm out of breath?	1
Your answer is so strange!	1
How sound asleep she is!	1
Why do you look so upset?	1
Young man, something's wrong if you're getting out of bed this early.	1
I Let's not break the law by starting a fight.	1
At my humble house tonight, you can expect to see dazzling stars that walk on the ground and light the sky from below.	1
I wish night would come, like a widow dressed in black, so I can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity.	1
I nursed her daughter, whom you were just talking to.	1
I'm at your service.	1
Your Juliet is alive.	1
Is it young Romeo?	1
Ah, where's my servant?, Give me some brandy., These griefs, these pains, these sorrows make me old.	1
Investigate how this foul murder came about.	1
Go wake Juliet.	1
We can't be in two places at once, both here and there!	1
Herbs, plants, and stones possess great power.	1
Well go on home.	1
Did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave?	1
Oh my, what's the news?	1
"I hear you say ""proud"" and ""I thank you, "" and then ""no thank you"" and ""not proud, "" you spoiled little girl."	1
Nurse?	1
No, it's not as deep as a well, or as wide as a church door, but it's enough.	1
Go, tell the Prince.	1
What are you going to tell her, Nurse?	1
Well, you're not on target there.	1
Nurse, will you come with me to my closet and help me pick out the clothes and the jewelry I'll need to wear tomorrow?	1
They're looking for you in the great chamber.	1
Now, before the sun comes up and burns away the dew, I have to fill this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers.	1
Your last guess is right.	1
Doesn't she realize how unworthy she is of the gentleman we have found to be her bridegroom?	1
She was tricked, divorced, wronged, spited, killed!	1
May God in heaven bless you.	1
They should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep.	1
No.	1
My head is pounding.	1
Then young men love with their eyes, not with their hearts.	1
I'll be with you right away.	1
Here comes the lady.	1
I can tell by his voice that this man is a Montague.	1
O flesh, flesh, you've turned pale and weak like a fish.	1
Tonight she is shut up in her room, alone with her sadness.	1
Brother, I'll go and bring it to you.	1
And death, not Romeo, can take my virginity!	1
Why, may I ask?	1
Good night.	1
Within three hours Juliet will wake up.	1
We're unprepared for this wedding celebration.	1
Goodness, it's daylight.	1
The most you hope for was for her to marry wealthy and rise up the social ladder, that was your idea of heaven.	1
I can tell you, but young Romeo will be older when you find him than he was when you started looking for him.	1
I'm ready.	1
What else is love?	1
May God choose you to receive his grace.	1
Are you trying to wash him out of his grave with tears?	1
Everyone says you can't make up your mind.	1
He struck me from under your arm.	1
You're this poor and wretched and still afraid to die?	1
Well, you have given me great comfort.	1
Good morning, father.	1
"Haven't you ever heard the saying, ""Two can conspire to put one away""?"	1
Oh, sad day!	1
Your wild actions resemble the irrational fury of a beast.	1
Oh, that most wicked fiend!	1
Oh my, my bones ache so much.	1
I know what I'll do.	1
She is in a better place.	1
It's a sweet lozenge that you choke on.	1
Oh, I wish she knew how much I love her.	1
How is my wife?	1
Oh heavens!	1
More and more light.	1
You know too much about suffering.	1
I can read.	1
Wish me luck.	1
Madam, good night.	1
Well, you have made a foolish choice.	1
Let's go!	1
Good morning, gentlemen.	1
Oh cousin, cousin!	1
And, when I do marry, I swear, it will be Romeo, whom you know I hate, rather than Paris.	1
We don't need to hear it.	1
Romeo killed Tybalt.	1
It's almost morning.	1
I'm done for in this world, I believe.	1
Oh God, I have a soul that predicts evil things!	1
Let me be captured.	1
I swear, you speak the truth.	1
It's been longer, it's been longer.	1
Now please listen, sir.	1
Who is her mother?	1
How long has he been there?	1
My back aches too,	1
Go, girl, look for a man who'll give you happy nights at the end of happy days.	1
These times of pain are bad times for romance.	1
Put it together with something else.	1
My daughter married death.	1
Go with me to the tomb.	1
Give me my fan, Peter.	1
Oh no!	1
Your love says, like an honorable gentleman, who is courteous, kind, handsome, and, I believe, virtuous, where is your mother?	1
I have news for you about the Prince's punishment.	1
If the news is good, you're ruining the sweet news by playing a trick with a sour face like that.	1
Give me my sin back.	1
Let me keep weeping for such a great loss.	1
You'll Enough of this.	1
Too fast is as bad as too slow.	1
The Get out of here!	1
Do as I tell you.	1
There's two, a man and a woman.	1
I'll give him equal thanks, so we're even.	1
Go tell him about this.	1
What, you don't say a word?	1
I'll cry my tears for Romeo's banishment when their tears are dry.	1
Madam, tell me quickly, what day is that?	1
If you could, you couldn't bring him back to life.	1
Was there ever such an evil book with such a beautiful cover?	1
To supper?	1
Oh, my liege, my wife died tonight.	1
This makes me feel so much better!	1
I'll never be satisfied with Romeo until I see him.	1
Be quick for a while and let the one who lives the longest take everything.	1
He says more in one minute than he does in a whole month.	1
What do you want from me?	1
I'll conjure him as if I were summoning a spirit.	1
Come, night.	1
Take me inside some house, Benvolio, or I'll pass out.	1
Tell me so I can be satisfied.	1
My noble uncle, do you know why he acts this way?	1
Don't worry about the cost.	1
Come, death, and welcome!	1
My master is the great and rich Capulet, and if you don't belong to the house of Montague, please come and drink a cup of wine.	1
Where's Romeo?	1
Monday!	1
Put the torch out, so I can't be seen.	1
Are you speaking from your heart?	1
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.	1
Wretched boy, you hung out with him here, and you're going to go to heaven with him.	1
Stand up.	1
How is my Juliet?	1
Take my advice.	1
What's this?	1
Give me some comfort, Nurse.	1
Signor Martino and his wife and daughters, Count Anselme and his beautiful sisters, Vitruvio's widow, Signor Placentio and his lovely nieces, Mercutio and his brother Valentine, My uncle Capulet and his wife and daughters, My fair niece Rosaline and Livia,	1
Your love says, like an honorable gentleman,'Where is your mother?	1
He's a raven with the feathers of the dove.	1
What a man, young lady.	1
I'll come with you.	1
Either go someplace private, or talk it over rationally, or else just go away.	1
She's dead, she's dead, she's dead!	1
I'll pretend to be the housewife for once.	1
Is it my mother?	1
Hey, love, I say!	1
Now he's ready for	1
Why are you waiting?	1
Pick up this rope ladder.	1
Your cheeks are thin because of hunger.	1
If there were two men like you, pretty soon there'd be none because the two of you would kill each other.	1
That might be the case sir,	1
But as soon as the sun rises in the east, my sad son comes home to escape the light.	1
Won't he?	1
What is this?	1
That's him, that villain Romeo.	1
Oh great, here come the Capulets.	1
Let's get out of here.	1
I'll go to lunch.	1
I wish I was your bird.	1
But I am thankful that you have found it.	1
Tybalt was my nephew!	1
Don't deny to him that you love me.	1
If I live to see you get married someday, all my wishes will come true.	1
I'm going to the Friar to find out his solution.	1
Have you done everything you could to make him tell you the reason?	1
Answer that question.	1
Here's Romeo's man.	1
Please, I beg you, don't scold me.	1
Otherwise, you'd see me blushing about the things you've heard me say tonight.	1
Hey, Nurse!	1
It is best to marry well and die young, better than to be married for a long time.	1
I'm glad he wasn't here for this fight.	1
I enjoyed a sweeter rest than sleep.	1
You poor soul, your face has suffered many tears.	1
I'll send my eyes to prison, and they'll never be free to look at anything again.	1
I'll look at him and try to like him, at least if what I see is likable.	1
It's torture, not mercy.	1
There, where the torch is burning.	1
"Break it up."" Then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down."	1
Have you come to make confession to this father?	1
I think he told me Paris was about to marry Juliet.	1
All this is comforting news.	1
You're making such a fuss.	1
Then you were right on target.	1
You have to contradict me, do you?	1
Don't talk back to me.	1
What?	1
Curse your families!	1
Darkness is stumbling out of the sun's path like a drunk man.	1
Oh, he's a lovely gentleman!	1
Eyes, look out for the last time!	1
I hate my name, dear saint, because my name is your enemy.	1
You're getting too angry.	1
You're right.	1
Good and noble young man, don't mess with someone who's desperate.	1
Well, well, I don't care.	1
I'd give anything to keep them from seeing you here.	1
Romeo will thank you, my girl, for both of us.	1
I have forgotten why I called you back.	1
Where are they supposed to come?	1
I made my father angry, so I went to Friar Lawrence's cell to confess and be forgiven.	1
And why did you come?	1
A greater power than we can fight has ruined our plan.	1
Ha, ha!	1
Is he man enough at this point to face off with Tybalt?	1
Do you bring me a letter from the friar?	1
I'm smart enough to find the logs myself without bothering Peter.	1
Oh, she's slow!	1
Are you biting your thumb at us?	1
Go to your bedroom.	1
I don't know, sir.	1
"Just say ""Yes"" and I will turn more poisonous than the snake with the evil eye."	1
"It would have been better if, after she said, ""Tybalt's dead, "" she told me my mother or my father, or both, were gone."	1
Oh luck, luck.	1
Hold the friar too.	1
I will leave here for Verona tonight.	1
Parting is such sweet sorrow that I'll say good night until tonight becomes tomorrow.	1
Whether it's even or odd, of all the days in the year, on the night of Lammas Eve, she'll be fourteen.	1
You have amazed me.	1
This is the most miserable hour of all time!	1
I won't break this promise.	1
I am the youngest man by that name, because there is no one younger, or worse.	1
Get up.	1
Forget about him, Jack!	1
If you're a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins, and you say you're my friend, how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment?	1
Do you have permission to go out and take confession today?	1
Let it go.	1
Very well taken, I believe, very wise.	1
If we look like musicians to you, you can expect to hear nothing but noise.	1
Before I could break up the fight, Tybalt was killed.	1
Is that how it is, really?	1
There is no life, but my love is dead!	1
Excuse me, sir, do you know how to read?	1
Who greets me so early in the morning?	1
Go on, go on.	1
Get me some ink and paper, and hire some horses to ride.	1
Think about it.	1
Death, which has taken her away to make me cry, now ties up my tongue and won't let me speak.	1
Come, I'll place you among the sisterhood of holy nuns.	1
But please tell me, can you read anything you see?	1
You don't know how to pick a man.	1
Uncle, this man is a Montague, our enemy.	1
Then I'll be quick.	1
I couldn't go to Mantua because I was stuck there.	1
I'd bet fourteen of my own teeth, but, I'm sorry to say, I only have four teeth, she's not fourteen.	1
Goodbye, dear Father.	1
Everything depends on this : either be out of here before the night watchmen take their positions, or leave in disguise after daybreak.	1
Flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than Romeo.	1
Please grant my prayer so my faith doesn't turn to despair.	1
"You're like one of those guys who walks into a bar, slams his sword on the table, and then says, ""I pray I never have to use you."" By the time he orders his second drink, he pulls his sword on the bartender for no reason at all."	1
If I do so, it will mean more if I say it behind your back than if I say it to your face.	1
Capulet, you villain!	1
But a lot of old people act like they're already dead, sluggish, slow, fat, and colorless, like lead.	1
He made this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed, but I am a virgin, and I will die a virgin and a widow.	1
Then I'll really give it to you.	1
For a full half hour.	1
Do you have news from Verona!, What is it, Balthasar?	1
Here in Verona there are girls younger than you, girls from noble families, who have already become mothers.	1
Who's that calling so loud?	1
I'll forget that I have any home besides this spot right here.	1
I headed toward him, but he saw me coming and hid in the woods.	1
At Friar Lawrence's cell she can make confession and be married.	1
That sound you heard was the It was the lark, the bird that sings at dawn, not the nightingale.	1
There are two opposite elements in everything, in men as well as in herbs, good and evil.	1
You disgust me, you little bug!	1
If I answered that question, I'd be making confession to you.	1
Don't say anything else.	1
My husband is alive on earth, my vows of marriage are in heaven.	1
I will kiss your lips.	1
Oh, it is my love.	1
Well, we can put away our pipes and go home.	1
O Lord, I could stay here all night listening to such good advice.	1
Oh, I wish I could make a My soul is calling out my name.	1
I make her angry sometimes by saying that Paris is more handsome than you are.	1
Oh, where's Romeo?	1
I won't listen to your pleas or excuses.	1
Romeo, come out.	1
He killed your relative, brave Mercutio, and then young Romeo killed him.	1
Oh, I'm very scared something awful has happened.	1
If I can't do it myself, I'll find someone who can.	1
Well then, I'll say this quickly : the valiant Paris wants you as his bride.	1
Have you had lunch yet?	1
So get out of here!	1
Tell me, Friar, in what part of my body is my name embedded?	1
Here comes your father.	1
I see.	1
I think I see my cousin Tybalt's ghost.	1
You'll be sick tomorrow because you've stayed up all night.	1
Our love, which right now is like a flower bud in the summer air, may turn out to be a beautiful flower by the next time we meet.	1
Your love will use it to climb up to your window while it's dark.	1
Holy Franciscan Friar!	1
I'm losing this duel of wits.	1
Oh my, Oh my!	1
Oh, she shows the torches how to burn bright!	1
If everything else fails, at least I have the power to take my own life.	1
In my desperate situation, I have to act alone.	1
And then I'll be the leader of pain, and maybe I'll lead you as far as death.	1
You kiss like you've studied how.	1
It's the lark that sings so out of tune, making such harsh noise.	1
It's some meteor coming out of the sun to light your way to Mantua.	1
It's still a long time until daybreak.	1
Tell her to come to me.	1
This is as bad as the tortures of hell.	1
In the meantime, hold on, and be patient.	1
Seriously, cousin, I love a woman.	1
Come break this up, Benvolio.	1
Can't I say something?	1
Not me, believe me.	1
He's thirty years old.	1
I remember very well where I should be, and here I am.	1
So, where should we eat?	1
I'm arresting you as a criminal.	1
Romeo, are you going to your father's for lunch?	1
Is the worst well?	1
Or, if you don't delay, make my wedding bed in the tomb where Tybalt lies.	1
Romeo is hateful, even though God isn't.	1
Oh painful sympathy!	1
Day and night, hour after hour, all the time, at work, at play, alone, in company, my top priority has always been to find her a husband.	1
You have more wild goose in one of your jokes than I have in five of mine.	1
Virginity makes her look sick and green.	1
There has never been so black a day as today.	1
Inside the little rind of this weak flower, there is both poison and powerful medicine.	1
No money, I swear.	1
Let me talk to you about your situation.	1
Let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed.	1
I'll go with you.	1
I have time for you now, my sad daughter.	1
Please, follow straight after me.	1
Where's Potpan?	1
Monday, my lord.	1
Curse the day!	1
Now, fellow, what have you got there?	1
The beautiful Rosaline whom you love so much will be at Capulet's traditional feast, along with every beautiful woman in Verona.	1
Well, death is the end for everybody.	1
She's not even fourteen.	1
You would take it back?	1
Hey, hurry up, hurry up!	1
Amen, amen.	1
This is a pitiful sight!	1
So stop crying.	1
Well, I'm glad about this.	1
Go to bed, dear.	1
Sadness over my son's exile stopped her breath.	1
Be happy that you're alive.	1
I didn't tell you to get rid of one love and replace her with another.	1
Now, I swear by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too, he will not make me a joyful bride there.	1
Get up, man!	1
Don't saints and pilgrims have lips too?	1
Go there and compare her objectively to some other girls I'll show you.	1
Everything you told me I already knew.	1
Just ignore him.	1
That's very soon.	1
Don't reply.	1
It's not daylight.	1
Oh life!	1
No, my good lord.	1
Good father, I'm begging you on my knees, be patient and listen to me say just one thing.	1
We shouldn't have too big a celebration, we can invite a friend or two.	1
Yes, you've been a ladies' man in your time.	1
Let's see how.	1
If he hears you, you'll make him angry.	1
Curse the day!	1
Have some others search.	1
I won't tolerate him.	1
And trust me, love, you look pale to me too.	1
Then the dovehouse shook with the earthquake.	1
Is the news good or bad?	1
Then who took my letter to Romeo?	1
You don't have to go yet.	1
Lose nothing?	1
Stay here for a moment.	1
I'm sure you have your hands full preparing for the sudden festivities.	1
No, I haven't had lunch.	1
You were the prettiest baby I ever nursed.	1
But if you have to swear, swear by your wonderful self, which is the god I worship like an idol, and then I'll believe you.	1
I'll frown at them as they pass by, and they can react however they want.	1
Only to be generous and give it to you once more.	1
I sent the Nurse at nine o'clock.	1
It's all the same.	1
Oh, look!	1
I'll confess to you that I love him.	1
The bridegroom is already here.	1
You scolded me often for loving Rosaline.	1
But come on, inconsistent young man, come with me.	1
His drugs work quickly.	1
Let playful people with light hearts dance.	1
By my count, I was already your mother at just about your age, while you remain a virgin.	1
Saints don't move, even when they grant prayers.	1
Three words, dear Romeo, and then it's good night for real.	1
Curse the day this happened, but it did.	1
Come along with me.	1
I think it's too rough, too rude, too rowdy, and it pricks like a thorn.	1
I'm locked up in a prison and deprived of food.	1
I don't like it.	1
Within an hour, one of my men will come to you behind the abbey wall and give you a rope ladder.	1
But I won't let myself fall for him any more than your permission allows.	1
Stop crying.	1
And yet you're the one who wants to teach me about restraint!	1
You mean their Cut off their heads, take their maidenheads, whatever.	1
If my heart's dear love, Well, don't swear.	1
I had a dream last night.	1
Has Romeo killed himself?	1
For shame, bring Juliet out here.	1
You haven't been conquered.	1
Come on, we're wasting precious daylight.	1
Hey, bride!	1
Oh, there's my lady!	1
Look, my love, what are those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east?	1
Night is over, and day is coming.	1
You had this child with the help of heaven.	1
You mean however they dare.	1
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady.	1
Tell me, my daughter Juliet, what is your attitude about getting married?	1
Why, then, should I cry?	1
She's too beautiful and too wise to deserve heaven's blessing by making me despair.	1
Alright, let's fight, boy!	1
Good afternoon, fair lady.	1
"Yes, "" said my husband, ""Did you fall on your face?"	1
I swear to you by my virginity at age twelve, I already told her to come.	1
Oh, what better favor can I do for you than to kill the man who killed you with the same hand that made you die young.	1
We mean well by going to this masquerade ball, but it's not smart of us to go.	1
Thank you, dear Nurse.	1
But I'm wishing for something I already have.	1
What?	1
Don't stand there shocked.	1
Don't stay here, go away.	1
Good night.	1
Do you think it's a good idea to rush?	1
I scolded you for obsessing about her, not for loving her, my student.	1
I bet it's a challenge.	1
"For himself to ruin, "" he says."	1
What do you want?	1
But it's enough.	1
Well, that one, I think, is young Petruchio.	1
You blush bright red as soon as you hear any news.	1
She will A pimp!	1
Romeo!	1
I want my sword.	1
I can see in your eyes that you're starving.	1
Yes, madam.	1
It is an honor that I do not dream of.	1
"Signor Valentio and his cousin Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena."" That's a nice group of people."	1
I'll be a harsh master to them.	1
He looks skinny, like a dried herring without its eggs, and he hasn't got his girl.	1
Madam, an eagle does not have eyes as green, as quick, and as fair as the eyes of Paris.	1
Put your hand on your heart and listen to my advice.	1
My dream told me that dreamers often lie.	1
Listen, your Romeo will be here tonight.	1
For when you cut your shin.	1
I'm not here.	1
Oh, Tybalt, Tybalt, he was the best friend I had.	1
I'll bite you on the ear for that joke.	1
Don't disturb the heavens any more by trying to go against heaven's will.	1
Well, girl, you're weeping not for his death as much as for the fact that the villain who killed him is still alive.	1
Juliet lies here, and her beauty fills this tomb with light.	1
Death has sucked the honey from your breath, but it has not yet ruined your beauty.	1
Go away and stay apart from me.	1
Come on, what did Romeo say?	1
Don't talk to me, because I won't say a word.	1
Maybe she can't find him.	1
Romeo.	1
Do you need my help?	1
But whatever misfortunes occur, they can't ruin the joy I feel with one look at her.	1
It's late.	1
I hope you sleep peacefully.	1
Romeo killed Tybalt.	1
Have courage, man.	1
Only you would look for a fight like that.	1
Are you going to say good things about the man who killed your cousin?	1
The fight is between our masters, and we men who work for them.	1
I will die and leave Death everything.	1
If he says anything against me, I'll humble him, even if he were stronger than he is, and twenty punks like him.	1
Look at other beautiful girls.	1
Either you, or I, or both of us have to go with him.	1
Now heaven has her.	1
Then I'll call you a serving-creature.	1
Feeling the loss like this, I can't help but weep for him forever.	1
Stand up if you're really a man.	1
Men's eyes were made to see things, so let them watch.	1
Hey, lady!	1
No matter.	1
They've turned me into food for worms.	1
You will also confess, I'm sure, that you love me.	1
Come here, man.	1
I'm biting my thumb.	1
This is the place.	1
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!	1
Hurry up, it's getting late.	1
You can't talk about something that you don't feel.	1
I hear a noise inside.	1
Go to the church.	1
Come, come with me, and we'll do the job quickly.	1
Sweet Montague, be true.	1
You take your beauty sleep now.	1
Showing mercy by pardoning killers only causes more murders.	1
Are you trying to start a fight?	1
I bet she's fast asleep.	1
Oh, for God's sake.	1
That is a certain truth.	1
Give my regards to your lady, and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed.	1
When evil is dominant, death soon kills the body like cancer.	1
I can't believe that dog, that rat, that mouse, that cat could scratch me to death!	1
From now on, take care of your messages yourself.	1
Onward, lover boys!	1
Wife!	1
Now I must go to the tomb alone.	1
"Don't say ""banishment."" From now on, you are banished from Verona."	1
Go, get out of here.	1
Are you going to provoke me?	1
What do you say, James Well, I don't know what to say.	1
Tomorrow is Wednesday.	1
Has Romeo been killed, and is Tybalt dead too?	1
We won't take their garbage.	1
I'll tell you more later about when and where we met, how we fell in love, and how we exchanged promises, but now I'm begging you : please, agree to marry us today.	1
Hit them!	1
"Hang out? "" Who do you think we are, musicians in a band?"	1
I've stayed up all night many times before for less important matters, and I've never gotten sick.	1
Love will give me strength, and strength will help me accomplish this plan.	1
Old Montague is here, and he's waving his sword around just to make me mad.	1
Peter!	1
Her blood has stopped, and her joints are stiff.	1
Nurse, give my regards to to your lady.	1
It's not earlier than that, I tell you.	1
My words would bounce her to my sweet love, and his words would bounce her back to me.	1
You go to Friar Lawrence's cell.	1
I'll teach you a lesson.	1
What is this fuzzy logic?	1
So the cooks who can't lick their fingers aren't hired.	1
Didn't he come home last night?	1
Oh Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead!	1
Why are you still crying?	1
Will you pull your sword out of its sheath?	1
How can I bring those promises back down to earth, unless my husband sends them back down to me by dying and going to heaven?	1
Was that my father who left here in such a hurry?	1
Let them judge us however they please.	1
I had only one child, one poor child, one poor and loving child, the one thing I had to rejoice and comfort myself, and cruel Death has stolen it from me!	1
We found him in the churchyard.	1
You lie.	1
Is it now afternoon?	1
Only God knows when we'll meet again.	1
Oh painful, painful, painful day!	1
Not to his father's house.	1
The other girl did not love me.	1
You, Prince, are the man who can give me justice.	1
Are you a man?	1
How is she doing?	1
The wound can't be that bad.	1
"I know you'll say ""yes, "" and I'll believe you."	1
Welcome back from Mantua.	1
Now, I swear, I'm so angry that I'm shaking all over.	1
Then repeat this after me : you can't expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable.	1
Were you here when it started?	1
Good man, why are you crying?	1
You'll find me ready enough to do that, sir, if you give me a reason.	1
I'm happy to meet you, my lady and my wife.	1
His love is blind, so it belongs in the dark.	1
You can't get out of trouble by praying or crying, so don't bother.	1
If I can trust my dreams, then some joyful news is coming soon.	1
You won't stand and fight.	1
Then don't move while I act out my prayer.	1
What do you want?	1
Start a fight?	1
He's dead.	1
No we're not, it's night.	1
Did he get away clean?	1
Give me a torch.	1
Oh, what a sad day!	1
Oh God, did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?	1
Romeo, get out of here.	1
Alright, here's the vial.	1
Go.	1
Romeo is coming.	1
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what did my love Romeo say?	1
Is it that early in the day?	1
I'll bury you in a magnificent grave.	1
Go be with your love, as it was decided at your wedding.	1
Romeo must die.	1
Why should you fall into so deep a moan?	1
There's a husband there who's waiting to make you his wife.	1
What about that?	1
I'm involved in your rivalry.	1
Tsk, you're wrong.	1
Ah, Juliet if you're as happy as I am, and you're better with words, tell me about the happiness you imagine we'll have in our marriage.	1
What, are you crazy?	1
Oh my!	1
And you told me to bury my love.	1
Welcome, gentlemen.	1
Ah sir, ah sir.	1
No, noble Romeo, you've got to dance.	1
Thursday is coming.	1
Destructive thoughts come quickly to the minds of desperate men!	1
Oh, sad day!	1
Sin from my lips?	1
Here comes my man, the man I'm looking for.	1
Either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight.	1
Whose house?	1
If that's not the case, then this must be the answer : You, Romeo, have not been to bed tonight.	1
Therefore your relatives are no obstacle.	1
There's plenty of time.	1
She's ready to go, but she'll never return.	1
Tybalt is lying over there.	1
What?	1
But like I said, when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple, the pretty little babe got irritated and started to quarrel with my breast.	1
Now you know the reason for the rush.	1
You're an insolent little boy.	1
Holy Saint Francis, this is a drastic change!	1
Virtue turns to vice if it's misused.	1
Indeed, I should have asked you before who he was.	1
Romeo's a dishcloth compared to him.	1
Well, do what you want.	1
He carries himself like a dignified gentleman, and, to tell you the truth, he has a reputation throughout Verona as a virtuous and well-behaved young man.	1
Give my regards to your daughter.	1
The world is not your friend, and neither is the law.	1
I'd rather they killed me than have to live without your love.	1
I'm not one of his sluts.	1
But I'll write again to Mantua, and I'll keep her in my cell until Romeo comes.	1
Every old man has worries, and worried men never get any sleep, but young men shouldn't have a care in the world.	1
Can your man keep a secret?	1
Poison, I see, has been the cause of his death.	1
Father, what's the news?	1
We have a little dessert coming up.	1
Yes, boy, I'm ready.	1
There is no world for me outside the walls of Verona, except purgatory, torture, and hell itself.	1
Flies can kiss her, but I must flee the city.	1
Goodbye, Goodbye!	1
Tell me, my good friend, what is that light over there?	1
Tell him so yourself, and see how he takes the news.	1
It is, it is.	1
Come on, wake up, wake up, wake up!	1
"Romeo has been banished."" That news brings infinite death."	1
Who's the one who's going out the door right now?	1
Amen!	1
I wish the fool were dead and married to her grave!	1
I sink under the heavy weight of love.	1
"Don't "" Yes, Nurse, what about that?"	1
I pay you because you're poor, not because you want me to buy this.	1
Don't think about her.	1
Unhappy fortune!	1
Good night, good night.	1
What villain, madam?	1
That's really news!	1
The curfew-bell rang.	1
Right, and well said.	1
Hold on, then.	1
There's still a stain on your cheek from an old tear that hasn't been washed off yet.	1
Oh pain!	1
Indeed, my child, at Saint Peter's Church early Thursday morning, the gallant, young, and noble gentleman Count Paris will happily make you a joyful bride.	1
What is this blood that stains the stony entrance of this tomb?	1
Give my compliments to your lady.	1
It's not the right time to play.	1
Can't you understand what I'm saying?	1
Goodbye.	1
Oh, deadly sin!	1
Tell me, so I can cut it out of myself.	1
You But, uncle, we're being disrespected.	1
Give me comfort.	1
Thursday it is, then.	1
I swear to you, You have a good heart, and believe me, I'll tell her that.	1
And with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces?	1
It's Mercutio's relative, noble Count Paris!	1
Show yourself in the form of a sigh.	1
I'll call you a minstrel.	1
Aren't you Romeo?	1
Can't you wait for a moment?	1
Tybalt wanted to kill you, but you killed Tybalt.	1
Oh wife, look at how our daughter bleeds!	1
Your humor is a spicy sauce.	1
Cruel, cruel Death killed her.	1
In the beautiful city of Verona, where our story takes place, a long-standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence, and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens.	1
I won't fail.	1
And now you cry, even though she has risen up above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?	1
So now turn and draw your sword.	1
Your servants were fighting your enemy's servants before I got here.	1
But like a misbehaved, sullen girl, you're whining about your bad luck and your love.	1
Is that the rope ladder Romeo told you to pick up?	1
What's going on, Juliet?	1
She's not even fourteen years old.	1
So to be banished from Verona is like being banished from the world, and being banished from the world is death.	1
Well, well, you have a careful father, child.	1
Give me that pickax and the crowbar.	1
Out of love?	1
Your face is mine, and you have slandered it.	1
But when I say so, I swear she turns white as a sheet.	1
Mercutio, be quiet.	1
Madam!	1
Your joke is a very bitter apple.	1
I'm begging you, good Mercutio, let's call it a day.	1
Give me your hand.	1
From the Earth's womb, many different sorts of plants and animals come forth, and the Earth provides her children with many excellent forms of nourishment.	1
Here's a drink.	1
You're not taking one step toward an enemy.	1
Come on!	1
I brought my master news of Juliet's death.	1
I can only repeat what I've said before.	1
"But to say that Tybalt's dead and then say, ""Romeo has been banished."" To say that is like saying that my father, my mother, Tybalt, Romeo, and Juliet have all been killed, they're all dead."	1
You say you don't know what the girl thinks.	1
I don't have the thing that makes time fly.	1
My eyes were liars, then, because I never saw true beauty before tonight.	1
Don't you have one word of joy?	1
Be quiet, for shame!	1
Out here everybody can see us.	1
Oh friendly friar!	1
Ha, banishment?	1
How can this be?	1
Death is my heir.	1
Calm down, gentle cousin.	1
Beat them down!	1
Down with the Capulets!	1
Who's that calling?	1
Is love really tender?	1
Madam, if you can find a man to deliver the poison, I'll mix it myself so that Romeo will sleep quietly soon after he drinks it.	1
I can read my own fortune in my misery.	1
You worthless girl!	1
Arms, make your last embrace!	1
"You'll fall backward when you grow up, won't you, Jule? "" And she stopped crying and said, ""Yes."" Now you stop too, Nurse, please."	1
Let them start something.	1
Madam.	1
I bet he slipped away and went home to bed.	1
She disgusts me, the little hussy!	1
Oh, I was such a beast to be angry at him.	1
You have the sacred power to cure both of us.	1
Oh, go away!	1
Benvolio, who started this fight?	1
That can't be.	1
Well then, saint, let lips do what hands do.	1
I love rich Capulet's daughter.	1
May a plague curse both your families.	1
Cheers, boys.	1
Oh, do you think we'll ever meet again?	1
I won't hide unless all the mist from my heartsick groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me from people's searching eyes.	1
Beat the drum.	1
Please, young man, don't make me angry.	1
Can't you find a reason without my giving you one?	1
You pale face!	1
Whichever of you acts shy, I'll swear she has corns.	1
I'll go alone.	1
Where is my page?	1
Now get out of here.	1
Listen, she loved her cousin Tybalt dearly, and so did I.	1
But go ahead and charm her, gentle Paris ; make her love you.	1
Lord, Lord, she'll be a happy woman.	1
Look, she's come home from confession with a happy look on her face.	1
Oh, my!	1
Don't swear at all.	1
Tybalt, old Capulet's nephew, has sent a letter to Romeo's father's house.	1
I hope maybe then you'll send him back home soon.	1
Oh, you're just going to talk about banishment again.	1
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand up.	1
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished.	1
There is nothing on Earth that is so evil that it does not provide the earth with some special quality.	1
Her eyes are saying something.	1
Who is that gentleman?	1
What are you, girl?	1
What do you think about Thursday?	1
And now you've changed?	1
And everything will be alright, I promise you, wife.	1
Where are the evil men who started this fight?	1
My soul and not my child!	1
Here are forty ducats.	1
How can you test them like that?	1
Her body sleeps in the Capulet tomb, and her immortal soul lives with the angels in heaven.	1
No, not until Thursday.	1
Let's go there.	1
My soul is made out of lead, and it's so heavy it keeps me stuck on the ground so I can't move.	1
That guy's funny.	1
The man who killed Mercutio, which way did he go?	1
With Rosaline, father?	1
You know where I live.	1
That's good, my boy.	1
Call to him, Mercutio.	1
I'll answer for you.	1
Why would you do that, my love?	1
Tell me if it's good or bad, and I'll wait for the details.	1
God forbid that I should prevent sacred devotion!	1
You started a fight with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun.	1
Or should we enter without apologizing?	1
What is this?	1
I've said nothing wrong.	1
Come, Romeo.	1
My lord, I wish Thursday were tomorrow.	1
We're bound to each other in every possible way, except we need you to marry us.	1
Alright, I will.	1
He deserves only honor, complete honor.	1
If love plays rough with you, play rough with Come on, let's knock and go in.	1
As I remember, this should be the house.	1
But now I have joyful news for you, girl.	1
Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I can find young Romeo?	1
Let me see her.	1
Please tell me.	1
He's been seen there many mornings, crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs.	1
No, good goose, don't bite me.	1
Well, we were all born to die.	1
I know where he is.	1
Goddammit!	1
Any man who knows how to write can answer a letter.	1
He was not born to be shameful.	1
No, not a sad song.	1
I'll make this wedding happen tomorrow morning.	1
What satisfaction could you possibly have tonight?	1
I pledged my love to you before you asked me to.	1
Then the window lets day in, and life goes out the window.	1
What does my hidden wife say about our ruined love?	1
Romeo will answer the challenge.	1
Look, look!	1
Get on your way and hire those horses.	1
Then she is well, and nothing is wrong.	1
Should I believe that death is in love with you, and that the awful monster keeps you here to be his mistress?	1
You should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide.	1
Oh, that's a joke made out of leather that spreads itself thin, from the width of an inch to as fat as a yard.	1
Well, that's an Stay, fellow.	1
Hey, mistress!	1
Our celebratory hymns will change to sad funeral marches.	1
Oh God!, Oh Nurse, how can this be stopped?	1
The boy is warning me that someone approaches.	1
"The women you rape are the ones who'll have to ""sense"" it."	1
What should I swear by?	1
Who is it?	1
I don't want to dance.	1
Is the Prince's punishment any less awful than doomsday?	1
I would have made it short.	1
"I stretch my joke for that word ""fat."" If you add that word to the word ""goose, "" it shows that you are a fat goose."	1
If I were in the habit of fighting the way you are, my life insurance rates would be sky high.	1
I had come to the deepest part of my tale, and I planned to say nothing more on the topic.	1
Oh, she knew very well that you were acting like you were in love without really knowing what love means.	1
Live, and from now on, say a madman mercifully told you to run away.	1
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?	1
Take a little vacation in Mantua.	1
Summertime in Verona has no flower as fine as him.	1
You, good friend, save me a piece of marzipan, and if you love me, have the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.	1
That's three hours since nine o'clock, but she hasn't come back.	1
What did my man say?	1
"Be merciful and say ""death."" Exile is much worse than death."	1
Be quiet, you mumbling fool!	1
That villain, Romeo.	1
Boy, your words can't excuse the harm you've done to me.	1
I'm a man, my lady, that God has made for himself to ruin.	1
Two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away on business, and they're asking her eyes to twinkle in their places until they return.	1
What does he say about our marriage?	1
But what do you say to my request?	1
You're a lover.	1
Although you bring me joy, I can't take joy in this exchange of promises tonight.	1
He locks himself up alone in his bedroom, shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight, and makes himself an artificial night.	1
Yes she has, and by keeping celibate, she wastes her beauty.	1
Shame on Romeo!	1
Romeo!	1
If you leave me like this, you're doing me wrong.	1
Go and get her dressed.	1
I'm only trying to keep the peace.	1
That dirty rat!	1
But why, you villain, did you kill my cousin?	1
You're in love?	1
We're ruined, lady, we're ruined!	1
Take my remark in whichever sense you like.	1
I carry no hatred, holy man, because my request will benefit my enemy.	1
Hey!	1
Sadness takes away our color.	1
That fair-skinned, hard-hearted hussy, Rosaline is going to torment him until he goes insane.	1
Now you're sociable.	1
The wind you're talking about is blowing us off our course.	1
Some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night.	1
Now he'll sit under a Let's go.	1
Here's something good.	1
Now my sin has been taken from my lips by yours.	1
Oh painful day, Oh painful day!	1
But I've been sent to find the people whose names are written on this list, and I can't read!	1
I'm in a rush.	1
Romeo, are you crazy?	1
Why, what's Tybalt's story?	1
I saw her buried in her family's tomb, and then I came here to tell you the news.	1
He'll wake you up, I bet.	1
A grave?	1
It's already almost night.	1
Look how she leans her hand on her cheek.	1
Farewell!	1
She's dead, deceased, she's dead.	1
What does Romeo say?	1
Why do you complain about your birth, the heavens, and the earth?	1
Perhaps there's still some poison on them, to make me die with a medicinal kiss.	1
Yes, well, things could get better.	1
What an annoying man, this guy is!	1
What I'm saying can't anger him.	1
Oh no!	1
Send for the Count.	1
He's not telling the truth.	1
The woman I love is beautiful.	1
I won't move to please anybody.	1
A jumbled confession can only receive a jumbled absolution.	1
Lucentio's son is older than that, sir.	1
Farewell, farewell!	1
Make it a word and a blow.	1
I'll go and chat with Paris.	1
I am tired.	1
Run to the Capulets.	1
Delay this marriage for a month, or a week.	1
The world doesn't make laws to make you rich.	1
Pharmacist!	1
Well, sir, because silver has a sweet sound.	1
I see that you are poor.	1
As we were trading blows, more and more people showed up to join the fight, until the Prince came and broke everyone up.	1
My generosity to you is as limitless as the sea, and my love is as deep.	1
I have already condemned and excused myself.	1
Speak one rhyme, and I'll be satisfied.	1
Did you have no poison, no sharp knife, no weapon you could use to kill me quickly, nothing so disgraceful, except banishment?	1
I hope you enjoy the same sweet peace and rest I feel in my heart.	1
Well, what was your dream?	1
Everything's out of control.	1
You mean I should groan and tell you?	1
Your life insurance?	1
We'll follow you.	1
What further pain must I endure in my old age?	1
Speak, nephew.	1
Give me the vial.	1
They lie in bed while they dream about the truth.	1
No!	1
I can tell that you don't know who I am.	1
So stay for a while.	1
Yes, if I know the language and the letters.	1
I must hide in the darkness for awhile.	1
Tell us what you know about this affair.	1
Sometimes she rides over a courtier's lips, and he dreams of making money off of someone.	1
But I would kill you by petting you too much.	1
Good morning, cousin.	1
You could not prevent her from dying someday, but heaven will give her eternal life.	1
Romeo ran away when Tybalt fell dead.	1
Oh love!	1
Perhaps you've learned from life and not from books.	1
Oh, so madmen like you are also deaf.	1
Rust inside my body and let me die.	1
How can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you're out of breath?	1
But he has to make his speeches of love to a woman who's supposed to be his enemy.	1
Do as you please, because I'm done worrying about you.	1
I want to stay more than I want to go.	1
If she was young and passionate, she'd move as fast as a ball.	1
Here is a friar who's trembling, sighing and weeping.	1
A beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest.	1
Be honest and helpful, and I'll repay you for your efforts.	1
No, cousin, I'm crying.	1
Don't worry about me.	1
Oh sweet Nurse, what news do you bring?	1
Then do my lips now have the sin they took from yours?	1
Just look at me kindly, and I'm invincible against their hatred.	1
I'll find Romeo to comfort you.	1
Go, you old housewife, go.	1
I'll give my vile body back to the earth.	1
Take away this body, and do what I say.	1
You will feel the loss, but the man you weep for will feel nothing.	1
My lord, you're wrong to berate her like that.	1
When only one or two men have all the good manners, and even they are dirty, things are bad.	1
Out.	1
Your head is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk, but your head has been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting.	1
Either my eyesight is failing me, or you look pale.	1
No, not him, though his face is more handsome than any man's, and his legs are prettier, and as for his hands and feet and body, they're not much to speak of, and yet they're beyond compare.	1
Oh my!	1
What do you mean I faked you out?	1
I want to take the love I had for my cousin and take it out on the body of the man who killed him.	1
Oh, you're wrong.	1
Therefore we'll have about half a dozen friends to the wedding, and that's it.	1
What time tomorrow should I send a messenger to you?	1
By nine o'clock.	1
If you act like my daughter, I'll marry you to my friend.	1
No words can express the pain.	1
Why, isn't all this joking better than groaning about love?	1
That's how flimsy and unreal pleasure is.	1
Give it to me!	1
Why the hell did you come in between us?	1
That's foolish.	1
Believe me, I'll draw my sword as quick as any other man if I see a fight starting and the law is on my side.	1
Now, before God, our whole city owes this friar a great debt.	1
Tell me seriously, who is the one you love?	1
We're talking here in a public place.	1
Cut off their heads?	1
Mistress!	1
Tell me, how did you get in here?	1
What, are you busy?	1
Or else love is blind, and its best time is the night.	1
Oh, by this count I'll be many years older before I see my Romeo again.	1
Here, sir, this is a ring she asked me to give you.	1
Are they washing out his wounds with their tears?	1
He was my brother's son!	1
Or, if he wrote down his thoughts, give me his letter.	1
But tell me seriously who it is.	1
Climb up to her bedroom and comfort her.	1
What, are you hurt?	1
How often tonight have my old feet stumbled on gravestones!	1
There's no point in looking for him if he doesn't want to be found.	1
Dinner is over, and we're going to get there too late.	1
Some kind of fountain?	1
Our wedding banquet will become a sad burial feast.	1
Yes, pilgrim, they have lips that they're supposed to pray with.	1
Oh, poor Romeo!	1
God bless you!	1
Shame on you!	1
Then I'll smack you on the head with the serving-creature's knife.	1
Even if it's not better, your first marriage is over.	1
Yes, a thousand times.	1
Please, sir, have patience.	1
Oh, this is a painful time!	1
Oh, holy Friar, Oh, tell me, holy Friar, where is my lady's husband?	1
"That ""may be"" must be, love, on Thursday."	1
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.	1
I've found it out.	1
You have so much natural talent, but like someone who hoards money, you use none of your talent for the right purpose, not your body, not your love, not your mind.	1
Now you're Romeo.	1
Lord, Lord, when she was a little baby, Oh, there is one nobleman in the city, a guy named Paris, who would be happy to claim her as his own.	1
I ask that again because nothing can be wrong if she is well.	1
You foolish madman, listen to me for a moment.	1
But he's not better than mine.	1
And it's good to have joy in such a joyless time.	1
Don't let the Nurse stay with you in your bedroom.	1
We'll have the wedding at the church tomorrow.	1
Can I go away while my heart stays here?	1
And then, I hope, you'll be satisfied.	1
Welcome, gentlemen.	1
Will I be married tomorrow morning?	1
Oh Lord, they're fighting!	1
But like I said, on the night of Lammas Eve, she will be fourteen.	1
I'll make you sing.	1
"Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished."""	1
Are you really going to tell me that?	1
Isn't that what he said?	1
The sun itself has never seen anyone as beautiful since the world began.	1
More and more pain for us.	1
Now that you are down there, you look like someone dead in the bottom of a tomb.	1
Hold him in custody until the Prince gets here.	1
Gregory, remember how to slash.	1
Is this the cure for my aching bones?	1
Don't say anything.	1
Probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband.	1
So I die with a kiss.	1
Calling death banishment is like cutting off my head with a golden ax and smiling while I'm being murdered.	1
You gave us the slip, sir, the slip.	1
Now I see the blood rushing to your cheeks.	1
A dog from that house will make me angry enough to take a stand.	1
They're calling for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen.	1
Your mother is coming to your bedroom.	1
He is the son and heir of old Tiberio.	1
That sounds like the voice of Friar John.	1
Peter!	1
Good morning to you both.	1
Please, tell my father, madam, I won't marry yet.	1
Nurse!	1
Therefore, love each other in moderation.	1
Look, and you'll see.	1
He lets the bird hop a little from his hand and then yanks him back by a string.	1
How can I marry him, this husband, before he comes to court me?	1
You're whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven.	1
Get away from here and leave me.	1
He knows what?	1
"Just cry out, ""Ah me! "" Just say ""love"" and ""dove."" Say just one lovely word to my good friend"	1
You should go to Juliet and dress her up.	1
The cure for confusion is not yelling and screaming.	1
I'll go call the watch.	1
I will.	1
