My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.	0
At your choice, sir.	0
Sir, a word ere you go.	0
Ay, lord.	0
And is it thus?	0
Where's Seleucus?	0
If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.	0
And when you do them, Cassius, be content.	0
It proves not so.	0
Now, then, we'll use His countenance for the battle, which being done, Let her who would be rid of him devise His speedy taking off.	0
You must be father to your brother's daughter, And give her to young Claudio.	0
A turn or two I'll walk To still my beating mind.	0
A calendar, a calendar!	0
The thought whereof Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards, And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am evened with him, wife for wife.	0
Come on and kiss me, Kate.	0
Peace, children, peace.	0
I am glad on't.	0
He says so, Tranio?	0
You, constable, are to present the Prince's own person.	0
Go carry them and smear The sleepy grooms with blood.	0
Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things.	0
Since this fortune falls to you, Be content and seek no new.	0
I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.	0
I, not remembering how I cried out then, Will cry it o'er again.	0
Farewell content!	0
Take heed, sirrah, the whip.	0
Why should calamity be full of words?	0
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven.	0
Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night, That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it.	0
Though for myself alone I would not be ambitious in my wish To wish myself much better, yet for you I would be trebled twenty times myself, A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich, That only to stand high in your account I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends Exceed account.	0
To th' monument!	0
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty, And, till she stoop, she must not be full-gorged, For then she never looks upon her lure.	0
"Tis done by me, and ends in ""Margaret."" Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself."	0
Ha, ha, heard in Genoa.	0
Is not marriage honorable in a beggar?	0
What may I call your name?	0
I'll not trust your word.	0
Down with the topmast!	0
Who hath sent thee now?	0
He, he,'tis he.	0
Do, do.	0
My brother killed no man ; his fault was thought, And yet his punishment was bitter death.	0
My liege and madam, to expostulate What majesty should be, what duty is, Why day is day, night night, and time is time, Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.	0
O heavenly mingle!	0
Tis no such matter.	0
By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.	0
If they have done this deed, my noble lord, If?	0
Get you therefore hence, Poor miserable wretches, to your death, The taste whereof God of His mercy give You patience to endure, and true repentance Of all your dear offences., Bear them hence.	0
Someone take order Buckingham be brought To Salisbury.	0
Know, sir, that I Will not wait pinioned at your master's court, Nor once be chastised with the sober eye Of dull Octavia.	0
Tis true.	0
A bitter fool.	0
In spite of your heart, I think.	0
Why, how now, Hecate!	0
To the health of our general!	0
Hast thou found my daughter?	0
You must not think then that I am drunk.	0
No, I pray thee speak in sober judgment.	0
Come on.	0
And, sister, as the winds give benefit And convey is assistant, do not sleep, But let me hear from you.	0
The manner of their deaths?	0
Thank you.	0
Do not rise yet.	0
Tis the curse of service.	0
Let good Antonio look he keep his day, Or he shall pay for this.	0
It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw, cold morning.	0
My lord, I'll tell you that self bill is urged Which in th' eleventh year of the last king's reign Was like, and had indeed against us passed But that the scambling and unquiet time Did push it out of farther question.	0
Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak.	0
Thou wilt write to Antony?	0
No, sir.	0
Madam, I'll take my leave.	0
Let that be left Which leaves itself.	0
It ish give over.	0
Dost thou hold there still?	0
Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.	0
Then patiently hear my impatience.	0
Is this the monument of Leonato?	0
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her, And therefore let me be thus bold with you To give you over at this first encounter, Unless you will accompany me thither.	0
I have a file Of all the gentry.	0
Am I not wise?	0
Now is the day we long have looked for.	0
To her, my lord, Was I betrothed ere I saw Hermia.	0
My life, sir!	0
I'll tell thee, Aliena, I can not be out of the sight of Orlando.	0
Who could refrain, That had a heart to love, and in that heart Courage to make's love known?	0
Therefore this project	0
I have an exposition of sleep come upon me.	0
It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out, To let him live.	0
Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee, Command the health of it?	0
Why, sir, cobble you.	0
If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live.	0
Signior, is all your family within?	0
Let me entreat you.	0
What hath he said?	0
So, adieu.	0
I know the boy will well usurp the grace, Voice, gait, and action of a gentlewoman.	0
I think the world's asleep.	0
There I have another bad match!, a bankrupt, a prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto, a beggar that was used to come so smug upon the mart.	0
Do you hear, Cassio?	0
I see him rouse himself To praise my noble act.	0
Then you can hear my news, as dessert.	1
As you wish, sir.	1
Sir, a word before you go.	1
Yes, my lord.	1
Is this really happening?	1
Where's Seleucus?	1
If I live to see it, I'll never trust his word again.	1
And when you do, Cassius, calm down.	1
It seems not.	1
I'll use Albany's power and authority for now to win the war, but afterward one of the sisters, whichever one wants to, can get rid of him.	1
You have to pretend to be your niece's father, and give her away to Claudio.	1
I'll go for a short walk to calm down my feverish mind.	1
We need a calendar!	1
I won't be satisfied until I get even with him, wife for wife.	1
Come on and kiss me, Kate.	1
Quiet, children, quiet.	1
I'm glad.	1
Is that what he says?	1
You, constable, are representing the Prince himself.	1
Go take them back and smear the sleeping guards with the blood.	1
Believe me, then, that I have special powers.	1
Since this prize is yours, Be happy with it, and don't look for a new one.	1
I came from Corinth, Your Highness.	1
I can't remember how I cried then, but I'll cry all over again.	1
Goodbye to my happiness!	1
Watch out, boy, remember I can whip you.	1
But give words a chance.	1
I demand this in the name of all the saints in heaven.	1
That's why I've begged him to come on our shift tonight, so that if the ghost appears he can see what we see and speak to it.	1
Though I wouldn't wish to be better for my own sake, for your sake I wish I were twenty times more than myself, a thousand times more beautiful and ten thousand times richer, just so you might value me more, so my good qualities, beauty, possessions, and friends would be more than you could calculate.	1
Go to your tomb!	1
My falcon is now hungry and unfed and must not be given enough to eat until she comes to me, for if her hunger is satisfied, she'll pay no attention to the bait.	1
"I've finished it for you, and it ends in ""Margaret."" He's turned your curse against you, Margaret."	1
Ha, ha, heard in Genoa.	1
Sex and marriage are honorable things, even for a beggar, right?	1
What's your name?	1
I don't trust you.	1
Bring down that top sail!	1
Who sent you this time?	1
It's him, it's him.	1
Thank you kindly.	1
But his punishment was bitter death.	1
Sir and madam, to make grand speeches about what majesty is, what service is, or why day is day, night is night, and time is time is just a waste of a lot of day, night, and time.	1
Oh, heavenly mixture!	1
Oh, well.	1
Really, he's very witty, and full of wise sayings.	1
If they have done this thing, my noble lord, If?	1
So go to your deaths, poor miserable wretches, the pain of which may merciful God give you the strength to endure.	1
Someone deliver the order that Buckingham be brought to Salisbury.	1
You'd better understand that I won't wait till I'm chained up in your master's court, and I won't let myself be scolded even once by dull Octavia.	1
Yes, it's true.	1
You're a bitter fool.	1
You love me in spite of your heart, I think.	1
What's wrong, Hecate?	1
Let's drink to our general!	1
Did you find my daughter?	1
So don't think that I'm drunk.	1
No, please, speak seriously.	1
Come on.	1
And, my dear sister, as long as the winds are blowing and ships are sailing, let me hear from you, write.	1
How did they die?	1
Thank you.	1
Don't get up yet.	1
That's the curse of military service.	1
I hope Antonio repays his loan on time, or he'll suffer for this.	1
It isn't good for your health to expose your weak body to the raw, cold morning.	1
Everyone thought it would pass then, and it probably would have had it not been for the great civil unrest and uncertainty of the time, which required the matter to be put off.	1
Good gentlemen, give me permission to speak.	1
Are you going to write Antony about this?	1
No, sir.	1
Madam, I'd better leave now.	1
Abandon the person that has abandoned himself.	1
It's all stopped.	1
Do you maintain the same story?	1
Come with me and let me advise you.	1
Then patiently listen to my impatience.	1
Is this the family tomb of Leonato?	1
I won't sleep until I see her, Hortensio.	1
I have a list of all the important men.	1
Am I not wise?	1
We've been waiting a long time for this day.	1
I was engaged to her before I ever met Hermia.	1
Killed?	1
I'm telling you, Aliena, I can't stand being apart from Orlando.	1
Who could have restrained himself, who loved Duncan and had the courage to act on it?	1
So she is drowned.	1
I really want to sleep now.	1
It was a huge mistake to let old Gloucester live after we blinded him.	1
You can command a beggar to bow on bended knee, but can you take possession of his health?	1
Cobble you, sir.	1
If you read this, Caesar, you might live.	1
Sir, is everyone in your family at home?	1
As a favor to Nope.	1
What did he say?	1
So, goodbye.	1
I know the boy will be a convincing gentlewoman, taking up her exact walk and talk and gentle gestures.	1
You'd think everyone was asleep.	1
That's another bad deal I've made!, a bankrupt, a spendthrift, who now has to hide his head on the Rialto, a beggar who used to look so smug in front of the other merchants.	1
Have you heard this, Cassio?	1
I see him revive himself to praise my noble act.	1
