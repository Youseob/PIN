Hang him, foul collier!	0
Nothing that is so is so.	0
Before me, she's a good wench.	0
Thou dost speak masterly.	0
My lord and master loves you.	0
Why, man?	0
Go, Sir Andrew.	0
And on the answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on.	0
You, sir?	0
Make the trial of it in any constant question.	0
Give me now leave to leave thee.	0
She's a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me.	0
He was a bachelor then.	0
Your will?	0
I know my physic will work with him.	0
Good gentle one, give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech.	0
I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.	0
What means this lady?	0
The captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maid's garments.	0
Why, would that have mended my hair?	0
I would exult, man.	0
Where goes Cesario?	0
I can hardly forbear hurling things at him.	0
I was adored once too.	0
Give me faith, say I.	0
I am no more mad than you are.	0
Fare you well.	0
Most villanously, like a pedant that keeps a school i' the church.	0
O Lord!	0
How can this be?	0
Shall I play my freedom at tray-trip, and become thy bondslave?	0
A love song, a love song.	0
A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful.	0
Orsino, noble sir, Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me.	0
He hath not told us of the captain yet.	0
Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born Not three hours' travel from this very place.	0
"Were you a woman, as the rest goes even, I should my tears let fall upon your cheek And say ""Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola! "" My father had a mole upon his brow."	0
I have heard my father name him.	0
Away!	0
For women are as roses, whose fair flower Being once displayed, doth fall that very hour.	0
I take pleasure in singing, sir.	0
I bring no overture of war, no taxation of homage.	0
Good.	0
Yes, being kept together and put to use.	0
Tis not so sweet now as it was before.	0
Marry, I saw your niece do more favors to the Count's servingman than ever she bestowed upon me.	0
Where lies your text?	0
This is as uncivil as strange.	0
How does he love me?	0
Why, sir, her name's a word, and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton.	0
Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not.	0
If I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to death with melancholy.	0
Do you not hear, fellows?	0
Alas, sir, be patient.	0
Alas, I took great pains to study it, and'tis poetical.	0
Notable pirate!	0
Yet you began rudely.	0
I thank you.	0
And so adieu, good madam.	0
The fiend is rough and will not be roughly used.	0
No, indeed, sir ; the Lady Olivia has no folly.	0
And you, sir.	0
I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that	0
One would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.	0
No, my lord, not I. Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety.	0
Lead me on.	0
Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.	0
He's fortified against any denial.	0
If I could make that resemble something in me, Softly!	0
What wilt thou do?	0
Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.	0
And, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be, cast thy humble slough and appear fresh.	0
I beseech you, do me this courteous office, as to know of the knight what my offense to him is.	0
Besides, she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her.	0
Your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.	0
You are now out of your text.	0
Pursue him and entreat him to a peace.	0
What country, friends, is this?	0
Yet there he was, and there I found this credit, That he did range the town to seek me out.	0
Since the youth of the count's was today with thy lady, she is much out of quiet.	0
Fate, show thy force.	0
Wherefore are these things hid?	0
Let us therefore eat and drink.	0
So, let me hear you speak.	0
So that, conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives make your two affirmatives, why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes.	0
I'll come to him.	0
I had rather than forty pound I were at home.	0
Thou shalt not choose but go.	0
But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valor, and drive the gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity.	0
Let me speak a little.	0
His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him.	0
But yet I can not love him ; He might have took his answer long ago.	0
Receive it so.	0
Let him approach.	0
He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.	0
Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia.	0
Ay, good fool.	0
Must she not then be answered?	0
Gentlewoman, my lady calls.	0
I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.	0
Damn that dirty black coalminer of a devil!	1
Nothing is what it is.	1
She's a fine woman, all right.	1
You're absolutely right.	1
My lord loves you.	1
Why, man?	1
Go, Sir Andrew.	1
And when he strikes back at you, he'll hit you as sure as you're standing there.	1
You, sir?	1
Ask me any commonsense question.	1
You may leave.	1
She's a good little woman, and she adores me.	1
When I first heard about him, he was still a bachelor.	1
What do you want?	1
I know my medicine will work on him.	1
Please, my lady, just confirm that you're the lady of the house so I can get on with my speech.	1
Apparently you think there's nothing unusual about a bloody head.	1
What's she trying to say?	1
The captain who brought me to shore has my women's clothes.	1
Why, would that have fixed my hair?	1
I'll be thrilled.	1
Where's Cesario going?	1
I can hardly keep myself from throwing things at him.	1
Someone adored me once, too.	1
God will protect me.	1
I'm no more insane than you are, and I'll prove it.	1
Goodbye.	1
Oh, he looks like a pathetic Sunday school teacher.	1
Oh, Lord!	1
How is that possible?	1
Shall I be your slave?	1
A love song, a love song.	1
Although many people said she looked like me, she was considered beautiful.	1
Orsino, sir, please don't call me those names.	1
He still hasn't told us about the captain.	1
I was born and raised less than three hours from here.	1
"If you were a woman, I'd hug you now and cry, and say ""Welcome back, drowned Viola! "" My father had a mole on his forehead."	1
I've heard my father mention him.	1
Now go!	1
Women are like roses : the moment their beauty is in full bloom, it's about to decay.	1
I like singing.	1
I'm not bringing any declarations of war or demands for cash.	1
Good.	1
Yes, if you kept them together and invested them.	1
It doesn't sound as sweet as it did before.	1
Well, because I saw your niece Olivia treat the count's messenger better than she's ever treated me.	1
Where's the passage of holy scripture that you're basing your sermon on?	1
This is as rude as it is strange.	1
How does he love me?	1
Well, her name's a word, and if you fooled around with it you might make her into a whore.	1
Let him be the devil if he wants to, I don't care.	1
If I miss this, let me be boiled alive.	1
Didn't you hear her, guys?	1
Please, sir, be quiet.	1
That's too bad, because I spent a long time memorizing it, and it's poetic.	1
But you're a famous pirate!	1
But you began so rudely.	1
Thanks for telling me.	1
So goodbye, my lady.	1
The devil inside him is rough, but we can't treat it roughly.	1
No, sir.	1
Hello to you too, sir.	1
The other day I saw him defeated in a	1
He looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding.	1
No, my lord, not me.	1
Take me.	1
My dear Miss Chat-her-up, I look forward to getting to know you better.	1
He's got an answer for everything.	1
If only I could somehow relate them to me!	1
What are you going to do?	1
Old age always makes people act funny, even wise people, but fools more than anybody.	1
To get used to the life you'll most likely be leading soon, get rid of your low-class trappings.	1
Please, do me this one favor : find out what I've done to offend this knight.	1
Besides, she treats me more respectfully than the other servants.	1
My lady Olivia, your niece, disapproves of your late-night partying.	1
You're overstepping your bounds now.	1
Go after him and try to calm him down a little.	1
What country is this, friends?	1
But he'd been there before me, and they told me he'd gone out looking for me.	1
Ever since the Duke's messenger visited Olivia, she's been upset.	1
Fate, do your work.	1
Why do you hide these things?	1
So we should eat and drink.	1
So let me hear what you have to say.	1
So if four negatives make two affirmatives, I'm worse off because of my friends and better off because of my foes.	1
I'll go to him.	1
I'd give forty pounds to be safe at home right now.	1
You have to come with me.	1
But I'll deliver Sir Andrew's challenge by word of mouth, describing Sir Andrew as courageous in battle and convincing the young gentleman that Sir Andrew is furious, impetuous, and a skilled fighter (he'll believe me because he's young).	1
Let's go.	1
He abandoned his friend here in an emergency, and even pretended he didn't know him.	1
But I just can't love him.	1
Here, take the ring.	1
Show him in.	1
He's as	1
Don't compare a woman's love for a man with my love for Olivia.	1
Yes, good fool.	1
Shouldn't she just accept that?	1
Maria, our lady wants you.	1
I saw you at Count Orsino's recently.	1
