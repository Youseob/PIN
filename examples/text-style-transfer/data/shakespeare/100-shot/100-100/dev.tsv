A wreck past hope he was.	0
And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly, To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.	0
How say you to that, Malvolio?	0
I can not love him.	0
I pity you.	0
Scout me for him at the corner the orchard like a bum-baily.	0
Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes.	0
If I think so, I think the same of you.	0
She's a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me.	0
Tell him he shall not speak with me.	0
Besides, you grow dishonest.	0
Peace, you rogue, no more o' that.	0
But if she can not love you, sir?	0
Has here writ a letter to you.	0
Too old by heaven.	0
I have limed her, but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me thankful!	0
On thy life I charge thee, hold!	0
Oh, that record is lively in my soul!	0
Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?	0
Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born Not three hours' travel from this very place.	0
He is sure possessed, madam.	0
Not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes, and Nay, my troth, I know not.	0
Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard.	0
Will it be ever thus?	0
He is about the house.	0
They lack retention.	0
I would be sorry, sir, but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress : I think I saw your wisdom there.	0
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?	0
If it will not, what remedy?	0
I have heard my father name him.	0
Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing, Though, I confess, much like the character.	0
No, sooth, sir.	0
Even so quickly may one catch the plague?	0
Then let thy love be younger than thyself, Or thy affection can not hold the bent.	0
Unless the master were the man.	0
To anger him, we'll have the bear again, and we will fool him black and blue.	0
I'll help you, Sir Toby, because we'll be dressed together.	0
You know, he brought me out o' favor with my lady about a bear-baiting here.	0
"Who you are and what you would are out of my welkin, I might say ""element, "" but the word is overworn."	0
Is it a world to hide virtues in?	0
He takes on him to understand so much, and therefore comes to speak with you.	0
Farewell.	0
"Is that the meaning of ""accost""?"	0
If thou darest tempt me further, draw thy sword.	0
I thank you for your pains.	0
Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to.	0
Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me, now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass.	0
What, to perverseness?	0
I speak too loud., Where's Malvolio?	0
Have I, Malvolio?	0
Though I struck him first, yet it's no matter for that.	0
These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too.	0
I tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.	0
He seems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to speak with you.	0
Taurus!	0
Master Malvolio?	0
The gentleman will, for his honor's sake, have one bout with you.	0
If thou entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling.	0
I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason good enough.	0
An I do not, Come, let's see the event.	0
I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others, to taste their valor.	0
Get you all three into the boxtree.	0
On a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither.	0
Still in this fashion, color, ornament, For him I imitate.	0
Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows We made each other but so late ago.	0
Here lies your way.	0
Fool, fool, fool, I say!	0
He shall see none to fear.	0
Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her, and her will is it should be so returned.	0
Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.	0
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.	0
Sneck up!	0
O, my poor brother!	0
Ay, my lord, this same.	0
That's all one : has hurt me, and there's the end on't.	0
And so adieu, good madam.	0
You should then have accosted her, and with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should have banged the youth into dumbness.	0
Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings.	0
Was not this love indeed?	0
Tell me your mind.	0
My duty hushes me.	0
I will be proud, I will read politic authors, I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance, I will be point- devise the very man.	0
This was looked for at your hand, and this was balked.	0
Why, what would you?	0
Go, Sir Andrew.	0
Hast thou forgot thyself?	0
Wherefore are these things hid?	0
But as well?	0
What should I think on't?	0
Here comes the Countess.	0
Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.	0
No pains, sir.	0
Oh,'twill be admirable!	0
It hath no tongue to vex you.	0
Tis not so sweet now as it was before.	0
There is a fair behavior in thee, captain, And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character.	0
But I know to be up late is to be up late.	0
I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me.	0
I saw't i' the orchard.	0
Would it be better, madam, than I am?	0
He was a wreck, almost past hope.	1
And I would die a thousand deaths cheerfully, if it made your life easier.	1
What do you say to that, Malvolio?	1
I can't love him.	1
I feel sorry for you.	1
Look out for him in the corner of the orchard as if you were a sheriff's deputy.	1
Nothing can come between me and the fulfillment of all my hopes.	1
If that's true, I think the same thing about you.	1
She's a good little woman, and she adores me.	1
Tell him he's not going to speak with me.	1
Besides, you've gotten unreliable.	1
Shut up, you troublemaker, no more of that.	1
But if she can't love you, sir?	1
He's written you a letter.	1
That's definitely too old.	1
I've got her now, but I've got God to thank for it!	1
I order you to stop!	1
Oh, I remember that very clearly!	1
Aren't you Lady Olivia's fool?	1
I was born and raised less than three hours from here.	1
He must be possessed by the devil.	1
And the doctors say it's healthy to get up early, I don't know what the doctors say.	1
No, I'm telling you, put on this robe and beard.	1
Are you always going to be like this?	1
He's somewhere else in the house.	1
They eat too much and get indigestion and nausea.	1
I think I saw you there, you wise man.	1
Will either of you give him the message that I'm challenging him to a duel?	1
If not, what can you do about it?	1
I've heard my father mention him.	1
I'm sorry, Malvolio, but this isn't my writing, though I admit it looks like mine.	1
Honestly, I can't.	1
Can someone fall in love this quickly?	1
So find someone younger to love, or you won't be able to maintain your feelings.	1
If only his lord were more like him.	1
We'll have another bear-baiting just to make him angry, and we'll mock him till he's black and blue.	1
I'll help you, Sir Toby.	1
You know, he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when I arranged a bear-baiting here.	1
"I'd say I was ""out of my element, "" but that phrase is overused, so I'll say I'm ""out of my air."""	1
Is this the kind of world where we hide our accomplishments?	1
He claimed he knew that, and that's why he's come to speak with you.	1
Good night.	1
Is that really what you meant?	1
If you insist on trying my patience any further, then take out your sword right now.	1
Thanks for your trouble.	1
Maria, take care of this poor fellow here.	1
Well, my friends praise me and make me look like an idiot, while my enemies tell me straightforwardly that I am an idiot.	1
What, faithful to being mean and nasty?	1
Oh, I'm talking too loud., Where's Malvolio?	1
I did, Malvolio?	1
It doesn't matter that I hit him first.	1
They're good enough to drink in, and so are these boots.	1
I tell you, I'm as sane as any man in Illyria.	1
He claimed to know that already too, and said that's the reason he's come to speak with you.	1
Taurus!	1
Master Malvolio?	1
The gentleman insists on fighting a round with you, for the sake of his honor.	1
If you love me, let me know by smiling at me.	1
"I don't have any ""brilliant"" reason for it, but I have a good enough reason."	1
I swear I will, Come on, let's go see what happens.	1
I've heard of men who pick fights with other people on purpose, just to see how brave they are.	1
Hide behind the boxwood hedge, all three of you.	1
I've only made it this far since I left her place, walking at a moderate pace.	1
with the same accessories.	1
But please forgive me, darling, for the sake of the vows we made to each other so recently.	1
The door's right here.	1
Fool, fool, hey, fool!	1
Well, he'll be dead, so he won't see anything.	1
You threw it at her rudely, and she wants you to take it back.	1
Keep a little bit of honesty, even if you're afraid.	1
What does You'd have a great hairstyle if you had.	1
So shut up!	1
Oh, my poor brother!	1
Yes, my lord.	1
It doesn't matter how I am : he hurt me, and that's that.	1
So goodbye, my lady.	1
You should have run up to her, unleashed a few excellent quips invented on the spot, and rendered the young man speechless.	1
Yes, sir, we're part of her entourage.	1
Doesn't that sound like true love?	1
Tell me what you want.	1
It's my duty to be quiet.	1
I'll be vain and proud, I'll read up on politics, I'll insult Sir Toby, I'll get rid of my lower-class friends, and I'll be the perfect man for her.	1
That's what she was expecting, and you let her down.	1
What would you do about it?	1
Go, Sir Andrew.	1
Have you completely forgotten?	1
Why do you hide these things?	1
As sane as me?	1
What's the obvious conclusion from that?	1
Ah, the countess is coming!	1
Cesario is my name, your servant's name, fair princess.	1
No trouble, sir.	1
This is going to be great!	1
It won't annoy you like me, because it doesn't have a voice.	1
It doesn't sound as sweet as it did before.	1
You seem to be a good person, captain, and although people who look beautiful are often corrupt inside, I believe that you have a beautiful mind to go with your good looks and manners.	1
All I know is that staying up late is staying up late.	1
Please, fool, go away.	1
I saw it in the orchard.	1
Would it be better if I were that, instead of what I am?	1
