How now, my lord?	0
A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuffed with all honorable virtues.	0
The greater therefore should our courage be.	0
Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that.	0
Do so.	0
Hold off the earth awhile Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.	0
I' th' clout, i' th' clout.	0
Lovers, to bed.	0
My resolution's placed, and I have nothing Of woman in me.	0
You are very welcome, sir.	0
You use this dalliance to excuse Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.	0
Alack, I love myself.	0
The bounty and the benison of heaven To boot and boot.	0
O dear son Edgar, The food of thy abused father's wrath, Might I but live to see thee in my touch, I'd say I had eyes again!	0
Had I plantation of this isle, my lord, He'd sow't with nettle seed.	0
Dost thou call me fool, boy?	0
Madam?	0
I overheard him and his practices.	0
No, you shall pardon me.	0
Drown cats and blind puppies!	0
In spite of your heart, I think.	0
My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire, As I by friends am well advertised, Sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate, Bishop of Exeter, his elder brother, With many more confederates are in arms.	0
Tomorrow will it please you to be crowned?	0
How now shall this be compassed?	0
O momentary grace of mortal men, Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!	0
It may be, these apparent prodigies, The unaccustomed terror of this night, And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today.	0
I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face when I last saw him.	0

Nobody come?	0
All eyes!	0
He is addressed.	0
But who is with him?	0
I prithee let me hear it.	0

Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.	0
Now in faith, Gratiano, You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief.	0
Villain, thou liest ; for even her very words Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.	0
Is this the monument of Leonato?	0
Ay, my good lord.	0
Think not I love him, though I ask for him.	0
Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are.	0
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace, Yet have we some revenge.	0
But know that I have tonight wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the name of Hero.	0

Tear him, tear him!	0
Well, well, We shall thrive now., Seest thou, my good fellow?	0
And now, I pray you, sir, For still'tis beating in my mind, your reason For raising this sea storm?	0
Hath put himself from rest, And must needs taste his folly.	0
Let him go And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.	0
Seest thou here, This is the mouth o' th' cell.	0
God pardon them that are the cause thereof.	0
What is't o'clock?	0
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste, Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste.	0
I know not if't be true, But I, for mere suspicion in that kind, Will do as if for surety.	0
Fathered he is, and yet he's fatherless.	0
Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used.	0
I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now That shall be wooed and wedded in a day.	0
The one of them contains my picture, Prince.	0
I'll bring you to him.	0
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since, Thy father was the Duke of Milan and A prince of power.	0
Where art thou, keeper?	0
If you meet the Prince in the night, you may stay him.	0
Come, Nerissa.,	0
To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.	0
I'll bring you to him straight.	0
Hail to thee, thane of Glamis!	0
I will stand, and so shall Trinculo.	0
The limit of your lives is out.	0
Moneys is your suit.	0
See, my women, Against the blown rose may they stop their nose, That kneeled unto the buds., Admit him, sir.	0

If the cat will after kind, So, be sure, will Rosalind.	0
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice And bring me their opinions of success.	0
It did bass my trespass.	0
What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet, But poisoned flattery?	0
Hath Leonato any son, my lord?	0
Caesar is sad, and Lepidus, Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled With the greensickness.	0
I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.	0
But I'll not chide thee.	0
Yonder they lie, the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping.	0
And how was that ta'en up?	0
That's true.	1
We're available.	1
Fine.	1
"What do you mean, ""wears the wreath""?"	1
By our beards (if we had them), you are a knave.	1
God be with all of you, princes.	1
Yes, my lord.	1
Who are you talking to?	1
Release me So I can return to my dukedom With your help.	1
You absolute villain!	1
What's this, my lord?	1
He's a lord to a lord and a man to a man.	1
But our courage should only be the greater for that.	1
I don't think you've got much of a reason to love me.	1
You need to.	1
Hold off burying her until I've caught her in my arms once more.	1
Whoosh!	1
Lovers, it's time to go to bed.	1
There's nothing of the weak woman left in me.	1
You are very welcome here, sir.	1
You're using this as an excuse for not showing up at the Porcupine like you promised.	1
Unfortunately, I love myself.	1
May heaven bless you.	1
If I live long enough to touch you again, that would be as good as having my eyesight back.	1
If I could colonize this island, my lord, He'd cultivate weeds on it.	1
The sweet fool in a fool's costume, that's me.	1
Madam?	1
I overheard him and his plans.	1
No, you'll have to excuse me.	1
Drowning is for cats or blind puppies, don't drown yourself!	1
You love me in spite of your heart, I think.	1
My noble king, my friends have informed me that Sir Edward Courtney and his brother, the haughty Bishop of Exeter, are now in My king, the Guildfords in My lord, the duke of Buckingham's army, Enough, you	1
Will you be crowned tomorrow?	1
And how would we go about doing that?	1
We spend more time seeking out the fleeting glories of this temporary world than looking to the permanent grace of God!	1
It might happen that these strange signs, the unusual terror of this night, and the urgings of his fortune-tellers will keep him away from the Capitol today.	1
I'm sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him.	1
Take your penalty.	1
Why did you send so many?	1
He's furious because she stole an adorable boy from an Indian king.	1
Nobody's coming?	1
Just watch!	1
They're speaking to him.	1
But who's with him?	1
Do tell.	1
I loved Ophelia.	1
Good Macbeth, we're ready when you are.	1
To tell the truth, Gratiano, you're giving your wife a valid reason to get upset.	1
You said those exact things to me back in the marketplace.	1
Is this the family tomb of Leonato?	1
Yes, my lord.	1
Don't think I'm in love with him just because I'm asking about him.	1
Be brave like the lion and proud.	1
We have feelings.	1
But I will tell you that I seduced Margaret, the Lady Hero's waiting woman, tonight.	1
How are you, my friend?	1
Tear him apart, tear him up!	1
We've got it now., Do you see this, my good fellow?	1
But please, father, the question is still nagging at me, why did you conjure up this storm?	1
He has to pay the price for his foolish actions.	1
He should go up and offer his petition to Caesar now.	1
Look here, this is the entrance to his room.	1
God pardon those who are responsible for Clarence's troubles.	1
What time is it?	1
And love doesn't have good judgment either, Cupid, has wings and no eyes, so he's bound to be reckless and hasty.	1
I'm not sure it's true, but just the suspicion is enough for me.	1
He has a father, and yet he is fatherless.	1
Come on now, wine is good for you, if you know how to use it.	1
He's going after a young widow.	1
One of them contains my picture.	1
I'll bring you to him.	1
Twelve years ago, Miranda, twelve years ago your father was the Duke of Milan, a powerful prince.	1
Where are you, keeper?	1
If you meet the Prince in the night, you can order him to stop.	1
Let's go, Nerissa.,	1
I'm saying it to the girl who isn't here and doesn't hear me.	1
I'll bring you to him right away.	1
Hail to you, thane of Glamis!	1
I'll stand, and so will Trinculo.	1
Your lives are over.	1
And now you're asking for money.	1
See, ladies, how they scorn me now.	1
Yes, now I'm in Arden, and that makes me the bigger fool.	1
I have no choice.	1
O, everlasting shame!	1
I have to tell you everything.	1
Oh, Pyramus, get up!	1
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap and munched away at them.	1
I'm being repaid for that now.	1
I'm afraid his mother may have had an affair with a blacksmith.	1
A cat in heat will look for a mate, And Rosalind certainly will too.	1
Go tell the priests to perform a sacrifice immediately, and bring me their interpretation of the results.	1
It sang about my crimes.	1
What do you get to drink, instead of sweet obedience, but poisonous flattery?	1
Does Leonato have a son, my lord?	1
Caesar is in a sober mood.	1
I could swear this is the real Vincentio.	1
But I'll stop rebuking you.	1
They're lying over there, and the poor old man, their father, weeps so piteously over them that the whole audience has joined him in grieving.	1
And how was that one settled?	1
