I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.	0
An if I be, sir, is it any offense?	0
Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!	0
All's cheerless, dark, and deadly.	0
Give me your hand.	0
Yet I'll not shed her blood, Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow And smooth as monumental alabaster.	0
Master, is this Mistress Satan?	0
Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die.	0
Beyond imagination is the wrong That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.	0
I know thee, Roderigo.	0
Who talks within there?	0
Your vessels and your spells provide, Your charms and everything beside.	0
Poor Tom shall lead thee.	0
Marry, we were sent for to the justices.	0
All the conspirators save only he Did that they did in envy of great Caesar.	0
No, uncle, I'll none.	0
But you, my honorable lords, may name the time, And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice, Which I presume he'll take in gentle part.	0
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.	0
Strike!	0
Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?	0
What ceremony else?	0
I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.	0
We will be witnesses.	0
And from hence I go To make these doubts all even.	0
Good sir, draw near to me.	0
I think the duke will not be spoke withal.	0
Let me go with him.	0
I should have chid you for not bringing it, But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.	0
What, not a whore?	0
Shall we be sundered?	0
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, Drink off this potion.	0
Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done, And I am pressed unto it.	0
Will your grace command me any service to the world's end?	0
There's no art To find the mind's construction in the face.	0
I will not choose what many men desire Because I will not jump with common spirits And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.	0
Thrice within this hour I saw him down, thrice up again and fighting.	0
Peter, didst ever see the like?	0
My husband!	0
For you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.	0
Why, would not you?	0
Come, Charmian.	0
Lady, you know no rules of charity, Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.	0
No more, I pray thee.	0
Kneel not, gentle Portia.	0
Is't not the king?	0
There's a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also, and your daughter.	0
I will discharge it in either your straw-color beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French crown-color beard, your perfect yellow.	0
Nature wants stuff To vie strange forms with fancy, yet t' imagine An Antony were nature's piece'gainst fancy, Condemning shadows quite.	0
O thou public commoner!	0
We should profane the service of the dead To sing a requiem and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls.	0
You have it full, Benedick.	0
Prithee, be not angry.	0
And if your love Can labor ought in sad invention, Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb And sing it to her bones.	0
We must not.	0
Alack, alack the day!	0
Do you smell a fault?	0
What is thy will with her?	0
And all my children?	0
And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats The immortal Jove's dead clamors counterfeit, Farewell!	0
Oh weary reckoning!	0
It is both he and she : Your son and daughter.	0
Farewell, good Strato.	0
Murder!	0
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill With sorrowful water?	0
One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth.	0
Tomorrow then I will expect your coming.	0
A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.	0
You do mistake your business.	0
Know'st thou Fluellen?	0
Didst thou hear these verses?	0
I thank thee for that jest.	0
That's strange.	0
Whate'er becomes of me, This is a soldier's kiss.	0
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes, Which after-hours give leisure to repent.	0
Ho, now you strike like the blind man.	0
Some dear cause Will in concealment wrap me up awhile.	0
But how long fairly shall her sweet life last?	0
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion, Have you a daughter?	0
Come down, behold no more.	0
I robbed his wound of it.	0
In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well ; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile life.	0
Oh well done!	0
Why, that's my dainty Ariel.	0
Where he arrives he moves All hearts against us.	0
All other devils that suggest by treasons Do botch and bungle up damnation With patches, colors, and with forms being fetched From glist'ring semblances of piety.	0
Oh, my soul's joy!	0
At the duke's oak we meet.	0
You say not right, old man.	0
Edmund, seek him out, wind me into him, I pray you.	0
Thou art to die.	0
Followed the old man forth.	0
Good night, good brother.	0
An unauthorized kiss!	0
Good duke, receive thy daughter.	0
Yearly will I do this rite.	0
My countrymen, Peace, silence!	0
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested.	0
His name is Balthazar.	0
I am only sorry He had no other death's-man.	0
My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.	0
I have to follow him and give him the letter.	1
What if I am?	1
Oh, the man who avenged her could ask anything of me!	1
Everything is gloomy, dark, and dreadful.	1
Give me your hand.	1
But I won't shed any of her blood or scar that beautiful skin, whiter than snow and smooth as the finest marble.	1
Master, is this Satan's mistress?	1
I could live a thousand years and I wouldn't be as ready to die as I am now.	1
The things she has shamelessly hurled on me are beyond imagination.	1
I know who you are.	1
Who's in there?	1
You bring your cauldrons, your spells, your charms, and everything else.	1
Poor Tom will take you there.	1
The court has sent for us.	1
All the rest of the conspirators acted out of jealousy of great Caesar.	1
No, uncle, I won't be married.	1
But you, my noble lords, may name a time, and I'll second it on the duke's behalf, which I don't think he'll mind.	1
My lord, I will give them all they deserve.	1
Strike!	1
Tell me again, where did you leave those lowlifes?	1
What other rites are you going to give her?	1
I could swear this is the real Vincentio.	1
We'll be your witnesses.	1
I'll leave now, to set all these things right.	1
Good sir, stay close to me.	1
I don't think he wants to be disturbed.	1
Let me go with him.	1
I should have reprimanded you then for not bringing it, but you started fighting with me first.	1
What, you're not a whore?	1
Will we be separated?	1
Here, you goddamn incest-breeding Danish murderer, drink this.	1
Just tell me what to do, and I'll do it.	1
Your highness, could you send me on a mission to the ends of the earth?	1
There's no way to read a man's mind by looking at his face.	1
So I won't choose what many men desire, because I won't jump on the bandwagon and include myself with the whole crude population.	1
Three times in an hour I saw him down, and three times up again and fighting.	1
Peter, did you ever see anything like it?	1
My husband?	1
You're supposed to show that you understand that Pyramus just went to check on a noise he heard and is coming right back.	1
Why, wouldn't you?	1
Play with me, Charmian.	1
Dear woman, you don't know the rules of charity.	1
Please don't tell me any more.	1
Don't kneel, noble Portia.	1
Isn't that the king?	1
The servants, the duke, and your daughter all seem to be treating you less kindly.	1
I'll play the part wearing either a straw-colored beard, or a sandy beard, or a red beard, or one of those bright yellow beards that's the color of a French coin.	1
Antony would easily outshine all imaginary beings.	1
Oh, you streetwalker!	1
We would profane the other dead souls here if we sang the same requiem for her that we sang for them.	1
Ah, he got you back, Benedick!	1
Please don't be angry.	1
And if your love can produce something from its sadness, write a poem for her ; hang it on her grave and sing it to her bones.	1
We must not.	1
Oh, how awful!	1
Do you smell something naughty?	1
What is your wish with regard to her?	1
And all my children?	1
And you deadly cannons that roar like thunderbolts thrown by the gods, goodbye!	1
What a tedious wait!	1
Your daughter and son-in-law.	1
Farewell, good Strato.	1
murder!	1
Stop arguing and listen to my plans.	1
We'll have one heart, one bed, two bodies, and one faithful vow.	1
I will see you tomorrow, then.	1
I'll give you a greater gift than that, nephew.	1
You're mistaken.	1
Do you know Fluellen?	1
Were you listening to these verses?	1
Thank you for that joke.	1
That's strange.	1
Whatever happens to me, this is a soldier's kiss.	1
Men act imprudently sometimes, then realize their mistakes when they have time to think about them.	1
Look at you, thrashing about like a blind man.	1
I have important business that requires me to remain in disguise a while longer.	1
But how long will her beautiful life last?	1
Since if the sun breeds maggots on a dead dog, kissing the corpse, by the way, do you have a daughter?	1
Come down, look no more.	1
I pulled it from his wound.	1
In the fact that it's solitary, I enjoy it very much ; but in the sense that it's private, it's terrible.	1
Well done!	1
Why, that's my dainty Ariel singing now.	1
Wherever he goes, he inspires compassion and people turn against us.	1
and patches of righteousness.	1
But I'm overjoyed!	1
We'll meet at the giant oak tree in the duke's forest.	1
You've got it wrong, old man.	1
Edmund, go find him.	1
You're going to die.	1
He followed the old man.	1
Good night, good brother.	1
An illicit kiss!	1
Good duke, come receive your daughter.	1
I will perform this ceremony every year.	1
My countrymen, Silence!	1
We can be happy that things have been resolved so agreeably.	1
His name is Balthazar.	1
I'm just sorry I had to be the one to kill him.	1
My noble lords and relatives, good morning.	1
