Do it quickly.	0
Ass, I doubt not.	0
Be clamorous, and leap all civil bounds, Rather than make unprofited return.	0
I am no more mad than you are.	0
If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!	0
Speak to me.	0
Never trust me, then.	0
Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my return.	0
I can hardly forbear hurling things at him.	0
Will you go hunt, my lord?	0
I do remember.	0
It shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did.	0
I'll have an action of battery against him if there be any law in Illyria.	0
What would you?	0
Hold, there's half my coffer.	0
But out of question,'tis Maria's hand.	0
By your patience, no.	0
Fie, that you'll say so!	0
But, come what may, I do adore thee so That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.	0
Tis too late to go to bed now.	0
"Go to, thou art made, if thou desirest to be so, "" Am I made?"	0
"It begins ""Hold thy peace."" I shall never begin if I hold my peace."	0
How will this fadge?	0
That you do think you are not what you are.	0
I know my lady will strike him.	0
Oh, I have read it.	0
What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead.	0
Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.	0
I told him you were sick.	0
Hurt him in eleven places.	0
Sir!	0
If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake my bounty further.	0
I must catechise you for it, madonna.	0
Where's Antonio, then?	0
Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me, now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass.	0
And you, sir.	0
A love song, a love song.	0
He seems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to speak with you.	0
I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.	0
I will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message.	0
Hath it not, boy?	0
I am bound to the Count Orsino's court.	0
Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.	0
No, I do not know you, nor I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come speak with her, nor your name is not Master Cesario, nor this is not my nose neither.	0
But what's your jest?	0
Fool, I say!	0
Has here writ a letter to you.	0
Why, man?	0
I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools' zanies.	0
"Cast thy humble slough, "" says she."	0
And died that day when Viola from her birth Had numbered thirteen years.	0
Come, begin.	0
Dear lad, believe it.	0
He knows I know him well.	0
Would thou'dst be ruled by me!	0
I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.	0
Now let's have a catch.	0
Good fool, some ink, paper, and light, and convey what I will set down to my lady.	0
I'll no more of you.	0
A gentleman?	0
A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than a hare.	0
O good Sir Toby, hold!	0
I know not, madam.	0
I would be sorry, sir, but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress : I think I saw your wisdom there.	0
This savors not much of distraction.	0
Do you not hear, fellows?	0
Have you no more to say?	0
I will construe to them whence you come.	0
If this letter move him not, his legs can not.	0
My servant, sir!	0
Sport royal, I warrant you.	0
There's one at the gate.	0
Jove, I thank thee!	0
I will give out divers schedules of my beauty.	0
What, Curio?	0
The competitors enter.	0
Not too fast!	0
I have heard my father name him.	0
He will bear you easily and reins well.	0
So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him, or the church stands by thy tabor, if thy tabor stand by the church.	0
I mean, to go, sir, to enter.	0
As I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to thee for't.	0
If not, an it would please you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid you farewell.	0
I will be free from thee.	0
Belike this is a man of that quirk.	0
But yet I can not love him ; He might have took his answer long ago.	0
"Were you a woman, as the rest goes even, I should my tears let fall upon your cheek And say ""Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola! "" My father had a mole upon his brow."	0
He hath not told us of the captain yet.	0
My most exquisite Sir Topas!	0
He's fortified against any denial.	0
Tell her my love, more noble than the world, Prizes not quantity of dirty lands ; The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her, Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune ; But'tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.	0
But he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not hurt you.	0
I defy lechery.	0
Marry, I saw your niece do more favors to the Count's servingman than ever she bestowed upon me.	0
A good lenten answer.	0
I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all, and he gives me the stuck-in with such a mortal motion, that it is inevitable.	0
This is a practise As full of labor as a wise man's art, For folly that he wisely shows is fit.	0
Is it so long?, Call forth the holy father.	0
Marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren.	0
Madam, I will.	0
Be quick.	1
Absolutely, you idiot.	1
Be loud and obnoxious.	1
I'm no more insane than you are, and I'll prove it.	1
If this is a dream, let me keep on sleeping!	1
You can speak to me.	1
Never trust me again if I don't.	1
Mr. Fabian, stay with this gentleman until I come back.	1
I can hardly keep myself from throwing things at him.	1
Do you want to go hunting, my lord?	1
I remember.	1
You'll get a bigger reward than you ever got delivering a letter before.	1
I'll sue him for assault and battery, if there's any justice in Illyria.	1
What do you want?	1
It's half of all my money.	1
It's definitely Maria's handwriting.	1
No, I'd rather you stayed here.	1
You shouldn't talk about him like that!	1
But who cares.	1
It's too late to go to bed now.	1
Go ahead.	1
"It starts, ""Shut up."" I'll never be able to start if I shut up."	1
Ah, how will this all turn out?	1
I think you're denying what you really are.	1
I know that my lady's going to end up hitting him.	1
Oh, I've read that.	1
Who I am and what I want are a secret.	1
Why, he has an income of three thousand ducats a year.	1
I told him you were sick.	1
Hurt him in eleven different places.	1
Sir!	1
If you tell your lady I'm here to speak with her, and bring her out with you when you come back, you might make me more generous.	1
I'll have to ask you some questions, madam.	1
Where's Antonio, then?	1
Well, my friends praise me and make me look like an idiot, while my enemies tell me straightforwardly that I am an idiot.	1
Hello to you.	1
A love song, a love song.	1
He claimed to know that already too, and said that's the reason he's come to speak with you.	1
Sometimes all I want to do is see plays and go out dancing.	1
I'll go on with my speech praising you, and then I'll get to the point.	1
Haven't you, boy?	1
I'm going to Count Orsino's court.	1
Here comes the man who rescued me, sir.	1
No, I don't know you, and my lady didn't send me to get you, and I'm not supposed to tell you to come speak with her, and your name is not Master Cesario, and this is not my nose, either.	1
But I don't get it, what's the joke?	1
Fool, I say!	1
He's written you a letter.	1
Why, man?	1
I swear, anyone smart who laughs at these courts jesters is nothing but a jester's apprentice.	1
"Get rid of your low-class trapping, "" she said."	1
He died on Viola's thirteenth birthday.	1
But come on, start.	1
My boy, it's true.	1
He knows I recognize him.	1
I wish you'd do what I ask!	1
I respect the soul very much, so I disagree with his belief.	1
Sing us a song.	1
Get me some ink, paper, and a candle.	1
I don't want to have anything to do with you anymore.	1
A gentleman?	1
He's a very dishonest, puny boy, and more cowardly than a rabbit.	1
Oh, Sir Toby, stop!	1
I don't know, madam.	1
I think I saw you there, you wise man.	1
Set him free.	1
Didn't you hear her, guys?	1
Do you have anything else to say?	1
I'll tell them where you come from, though I don't know who you are or what you want.	1
If this letter doesn't make him fight, I don't know what will.	1
My servant!	1
It's going to be fun, I promise.	1
I told you, someone's at the gate.	1
Dear God, thank you!	1
I'll write out a detailed inventory of my beauty and label every part.	1
Hunting what, Curio?	1
Here come the conspirators.	1
Ah, no.	1
I've heard my father mention him.	1
You can ride him easily, and he responds well when you pull the reins.	1
"You could just as easily say that a king sleeps near a beggar if the beggar lives near him, or that the church is supported by your drum because it ""stands by"" your drum."	1
I mean please go into the house, sir.	1
You have my word as a gentleman that I'll always be grateful to you.	1
If you can't, and would prefer to leave, she's very willing to say goodbye to you.	1
I'll get free of you.	1
This man is probably like that.	1
But I just can't love him.	1
"If you were a woman, I'd hug you now and cry, and say ""Welcome back, drowned Viola! "" My father had a mole on his forehead."	1
He still hasn't told us about the captain.	1
The brilliant Sir Topas!	1
He's got an answer for everything.	1
Tell her my love is purer than anything else in the whole world, and has nothing to do with her property.	1
But as a gentleman and a soldier he's promised me he won't hurt you.	1
I defy brain-death!	1
Well, because I saw your niece Olivia treat the count's messenger better than she's ever treated me.	1
That's a lame answer.	1
I had a round with him, and his sword thrust is so deadly that you can't even duck out of the way.	1
And he doesn't let go of his target when a distraction appears.	1
Has it been so long?	1
But oops, when I let go of your hand, I let go of the biggest joke of all.	1
Madam, I will.	1
